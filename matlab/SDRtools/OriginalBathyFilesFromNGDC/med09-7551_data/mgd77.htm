I.                      INTRODUCTION


     In January of 1977, a group of 24 geophysical data
managers from academia, government, industry and foreign
countries participated in a workshop at the National
Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) in Boulder, Colorado.  The
"Workshop for Marine Geophysical Data Formats" established
the basic outline of a new format for the exchange of
digital underway geophysics data.  A six member task force
was formed to work with NGDC in implementing the decisions
of the workshop into the new format.  By the end of 1977 the
"MGD77" format was being disseminated by NGDC as its
standard exchange format.

     The "MGD77" format has experienced much success over
the past 15 years.  It has been sanctioned by the Intergov-
ernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) as an accepted
standard for international data exchange, and it has been
translated into French, Japanese, and Russian.  Most con-
tributors of data to NGDC now send transfer data over the
internet in the "MGD77" format.

     This newest revision makes the MGD77 format "Year 2000
Compliant", ensuring it's success into 21st Century.     






II.                  GENERAL DESCRIPTION


     The digital format presented, and referred to as
"MGD77", is an exchange format for marine geophysical data
(bathymetry, magnetics, and gravity)  It is intended to be
used for the transmission of data to and from a data center
and may be useful for the exchange of data to and from a
data center and may be useful for the exchange of data
between marine institutions.  Data is to be exchanged in
files, one file per survey operation.  Generally each survey
operation is a port-to-port operation of a survey vessel,
but in some cases several port-to-port operations of the
same vessel are combined in single survey operation,
especially if this is the manner of organizing the data at
the contributing institution.  Data may be exchanged on via
the Internet or on various mass storage devices such as 8mm
or 9 track tapes, removable disks.  The National Geophysical
Data Center uses CD-ROM disks as its chief method of distribution
of these data.



Data Exchange

     1. For exchange of MGD77 data via mass storage files on
     magnetic or optical media participants shall establish type
     and format of the media to be exchanged.

     2. Each survey operation shall be contained in one file
     with Header and Data Records, or in 2 files, one Header
     file and one Data Record file.  If  the media is too small
     to contain one survey the data may be continued on a second
     media.

     3. Each survey operation shall have one MGD77 Header 
     consisting of 24 80-character logical records.

     4. The MGD77 data records are sequentially and chronologically
     organized until the end of the file.  The data records are 120
     logical characters.

     5. A survey is defined as all observations that conveniently
     constitute a survey operation (e.g., a port-to-port survey or
     in some cases several surveys).  A survey file(s) ideally
     should not span two media.

      6. For sequential files, the MGD77 Header shall consist of
      24 sequential records of 80 logical characters each separated
      by an end-of-record character(s) and, if the data records are
      in the same file, the Header shall be at the beginning of the
      file.  The MGD77 Data Records shall be 120 logical characters
      each.

      7. 9 Track tapes should be recorded as ASCI 1600 or 6250 BPI.
      The tape structure consists of physical records of 1920
      characters each, a header followed by data records, separated
      by inter-record gaps (IRG) and organized into files. The files
      are separated by end-of-file (EOF) marks (sometimes called
      tape marks).






III.                  THE HEADER RECORD


     The purpose of the Header Record is to document both
the content and structure of the geophysical data contained
within subsequent data records.  In general, documentation
that is constant throughout the survey will be in the Header
Record, while documentation that is variable will be in the
Data Records.

     For sequential files, the MGD77 Header consists of 24
80-character sequential records.  For 9 track magnetic tapes
the MGD77 Header is a physical record (block) consisting of
1,920 characters. In both cases the data records follow
immediately with no intervening end-of-file marks.

     The Header Record contains fields which are both fixed
and freely formatted.  All field lengths within the Header
that have not been coded with information should be blank-
filled, and all plain language statements should be left-
justified.  The Header consists of a "sequence" of twenty-
four 80-character images.  The field lengths within the
Header Records are designed to allow one to read the
information (from magnetic tapes) as a series of 120-
character logical records -- the same logical record length
as the data records.

     To help the marine geophysical community prepare this
documentation, a coding pad is available free of charge from
the National Geophysical Data Center.


Format Conventions for the Header Record:

1. All decimal points are implied (e.g. 1234 in 10ths of units means 123.4)
2. Leading zeros and blanks are equivalent.
3. Unknown or unused fields are to be blank filled.
4. All "corrections", such as time zone, diurnal magnetics,
   and Eotvos, are understood to be added (e.g., time-zone
   correction is the number of hours which must be added
   to the recorded time to determine GMT).


The following is a detailed description of the Header Record.
Fields can be of type integer, real or character.  Fields that
represent whole numbers are integers  Fields that contain a
decimal component are real, and fields that are alphanumeric
are character.

______________

** Fields 41-54 in sequence Number 11 and Fields 1-78 in
sequence numbers 16 and 17 may be blank filled by the
contributing institution.  The data center can determine
these numbers by a computer search of the latitudes and
longitudes within the MGD77 file.





IV.                    THE DATA RECORD


     The data record presents underway marine geophysical
data in a correlative manner.  Geophysical data (bathymetry,
magnetics, and gravity) and seismic identification (shot-point
identification) are presented with a corresponding time and
position.  Documentation that is variable throughout the
survey also is included within each data record.  If primary
navigation exists at a juncture where no geophysical data
are present, this record should be included with the data
parameter fields left unused (9s filled).

     The logical record length is 120 characters and the
blocking factor is 16 logical records per physical record
(i.e., 1,920 characters).



Format Conventions:

     1. All decimal points are implied (e.g. 1234 in 10ths of units means 123.4)
     
     2. Leading zeros and blanks are equivalent.
     
     3. Unknown or unused fields are to be filled with 9s
     (DO NOT BLANK FILL).
        
     4. All "corrections", such as time zone, diurnal
     magnetics, and Eotvos, are understood to be added
     (e.g., time-zone correction is the number of hours
     which must be added to the recorded time to
     determine GMT).

APPENDIX A      10-DEGREE-SQUARE IDENTIFIER CODE


A 10-degree-square area can be easily identified by
constructing a four-digit number.  The components of this
number, in order of their construction are described as
follows:

Quadrant - A one-digit number identifies the quadrant of the
world with the following significance to each digit:

   1st digit = Quadrant number

   Qc Code         Latitude        Longitude
   _______         ________        _________
   
      1            North           East
      3            South           East
      5            South           West
      7            North           West

10-Degree Square - The next three digits identify a unique
10-degree square; thus, the significant digits consist of:

           2nd digit = Tens digit of degrees latitude
           3rd digit = Hundreds digit of degrees longitude
           4th digit = Tens digit of degrees longitude
