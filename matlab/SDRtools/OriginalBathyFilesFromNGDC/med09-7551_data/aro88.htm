I.                      INTRODUCTION

     During 1988 the National Geophysical Data Center decided
to integrate it's collection of worldwide aeromagnetic survey 
data into the already existing GEODAS (GEOphysical DAta System)
data managment system.  In doing this NGDC created a digital
header to document key information about these surveys.  As can be
seen below, the ARO88 header was patterned after the ever popular 
MGD77 exchange format header.  (It was decided not to attempt to
introduce a common format for the aeromagnetic data records.)
Integrating NGDC's aeromagnetic data into GEODAS systems allows 
for assimilation into an already developed system and a standardized
software interface for the user.  







II.                  GENERAL DESCRIPTION


     The digital format presented, and referred to as "ARO88",
is a format for aeromagnetic survey headers.  It is intended to 
be used for the transmission of data to and from a data center
and may be useful for the exchange of data between marine 
institutions.  This meta-data can be exchanged as a companion file to
the aeromagnetic data files, which have various formats, generally being
in the original format as recieved by NGDC from the source contributor.
Data may be exchanged on various mass storage devices such as floppy 
disks, 8mm tape, or optical media or over the Internet.  The National 
Geophysical Data Center uses CD/DVD disks as its chief method of 
distribution of these data.


  




III.                  THE ARO88 HEADER RECORD


     The purpose of the Header Record is to document both
the content and structure of the aeromagnetic data contained
within the data records.  In general, documentation that is
constant throughout the cruise will be in the Header Record,
while documentation that is variable will be in the Data Records.

     On mass storage media, the ARO88 Header consists of a file
of 24 80-character sequential records.
  
     The Header Record contains fields which are both fixed
and freely formatted.  All field lengths within the Header
that have not been coded with information should be blank-
filled, and all plain language statements should be left-
justified.  The Header consists of a "sequence" of twenty-
four 80-character images.

*** CHANGES SINCE LAST REVISION ***

Several changes in the ARO88 Format were required in order to
make the format "Year 2000 Compliant" (Y2K Compliant):

IV.                    THE DATA RECORDS


     The Aeromagnetic Survey records at NGDC are organized by survey
operation, one survey per file.  The data records have been kept in the
same format as they were recieved in.  They may have been re-worked, but
generally not re-formatted.  To find out more about these files please
contact Ron Buhmann or Stuart Racey. (see NGDC CONTACTS below)
 
___________________________________________________________




                        
APPENDIX A        10-DEGREE-SQUARE IDENTIFIER CODE

A 10-degree-square area can be easily identified by
constructing a four-digit number.  The components of this
number, in order of their construction are described as
follows:

Quadrant - A one-digit number identifies the quadrant of the
world with the following significance to each digit:

   1st digit = Quadrant number

   Qc Code         Latitude        Longitude
   _______         ________        _________
   
      1            North           East
      3            South           East
      5            South           West
      7            North           West

10-Degree Square - The next three digits identify a unique
10-degree square; thus, the significant digits consist of:

           2nd digit = Tens digit of degrees latitude
           3rd digit = Hundreds digit of degrees longitude
           4th digit = Tens digit of degrees longitude

                                    ________________________
                                      
EXAMPLES:                                Qc   Lat  Long Long
  (i) 37 degrees 48'S, 4 degrees 13'E    3    3    0    0
 (ii) 21.6 degrees S, 14.3 degrees W     5    2    0    1
(iii) 34 degrees 28'N, 143 degrees 27'W  7    3    1    4
