I.   INTRODUCTION

     During 2000 the Marine Geology & Geophysics Division of the
National Geophysical Data Center undertook the development of
software for coastline data.  In doing so a generalized format
for vector data was implemented. This format is geared toward
coastline data, but can be used for other vector applications.



II.   GENERAL DESCRIPTION

     The VCT00 Format, is a digital format for the storage of 2-D
vector data. Though developed for high resolution boundary
(coastline) data, the format can handle other types of vector
data. It is very utilitarian format and contains no documentation
about the data (such as information about references, methods and
datums used, etc.). Rather VCT00 formatted files only contain
vector data records and headers with minimal geographic and 
file-indexing information.
     VCT00 formatted files can be either binary or ASCII.  VCT00
binary files consist of a series of Header Records followed by
Data Records.  VCT00 ASCII files contain only the Data Records.
The Binary VCT00 "physical records", both Header and Data, are 10
bytes each, and contain two signed 4-byte integers followed by
one signed 2 byte integer. The Headers contain four of these
physical records; the Data records consist of one record for each
"point".  Each Header represents a geographic box or "Block"
containing a series of line segments. Each Header contains the
"Address" (record number) where those data segments start in the
file, the "Type" of data the segments represent, an optional
"Value" for the data, the total Number of Points in the data
segments, and the latitude/longitude limits of the Block of data.
Data Records for both Binary and ASCII VCT00 files contain
resolution information, so a single file can be plotted at
several different resolutions, by sub-setting the data for
different resolutions.
     The VCT00 format can be used for the exchange of 2-D vector
data, using virtually any media type.  The National Geophysical
Data Center uses CD/DVD disks as its chief method of distribution
of these data.



III.   HEADERS (Binary VCT00)

     The purpose of each binary Header is to locate and describe
the vector data which it (geographically) encompasses.

     Each VCT00 Header is 40 bytes in length and consists of 4 10-
byte records, each of which contains two signed 4-byte integers
followed by one signed 2 byte integer.

     The Header records are all together at the start of the
file.

     The last Header Record is an "empty" Header. This indicates
that there are no more Headers. Data records immediately follow
this Header.

     The following is a detailed description of the Header fields


FIELD NAME         NUMBER TYPE     DESCRIPTION
________________________________________________________

Address of Data    4 Byte Integer  File record number of
                                   the first point of the vector data
                                   which the Header represents. Record
                                   numbers start at 1 and are10 bytes
                                   each.

Number of Records  4 Byte Integer  Total number of
                                   points (vertices) represented by
                                   this Header

Type of Data       2 Byte Integer  For delineating
                                   different types of vector data. e.g.
                                   for geographic boundary data,
                                   1=coastlines 2=primary international
                                   boundaries, 3= secondary boundaries
                                   such as US states, etc. A Type of -1
                                   is used for the last (no records)
                                   Block of the file.

Data Attribute    4 Byte Integer   A value can be
or Value                           attached to the data which the
                                   Header represents. E.g. for
                                   toptographic contours, this could
                                   represent a contour value for all
                                   the contours in this Header.

IV.   DATA (Binary VCT00)
         
The binary VCT00 Headers are followed immediately by the binary
vector data records. The data records for a specific Header can
only be delineated by the information in the Header record. The
data records for a specific Header are broken up into a number of
line segments. The "Pencode" field is used to determine extent of
these line segments. The Type, (optional) Value and number of
points of the line segment data for a particular Header are
described in the Header Record.

The data records are 10 bytes and each record contains two signed
4-byte integers followed by one signed 2 byte integer.

The plotting instructions (MoveTo or LineTo) are contained within
the Pencode Field. The Pencode also contains resolution
information. Each Non-Zero pencode value is evenly divisible by a
number of Resolution Values, meaning that the lat/lon point
"belongs" to those particular resolutions.  This Resolution Value
is one of the first 7 prime numbers, the value of which increases
with lower Resolution. To plot at a particular resolution you
would only plot those points which have a Pencode which is evenly
divisible by your particular Resolution Value. For full
resolution this Resolution Value would be 1. The remaining
Resolution Values increase through the Prime Numbers as the
desired resolution decreases (i.e. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13). Thus a
simple Modulus Function can be used to determine whether to plot
specific point.  The usable resolutions can be thought of as
Full, High, Medium-High, Medium, Medium-Low, Low, Crude.

     The following is a detailed description of the Binary Data
Record fields


FIELD NAME     NUMBER TYPE     DESCRIPTION
________________________________________________________

Latitude       4 Byte Integer  Latitude of the
                               point, in millionths of degrees
                               (decimal degrees times 1,000,000).

Longitude      4 Byte Integer  Longitude of the
                               point, in millionths of degrees.

Pencode        2 Byte Integer  Delineates the flow of the segments:
                               0 - Start, MoveTo Pt (Pen up Move)
                               1 - Full Res, LineTo Pt (Pen Down Move)
                               Factor of 2 - Second Level Res LineTo Pt
                               Factor of 3 - Third Level Res LineTo Pt
                               Factor of 5 - Fourth Level Res LineTo Pt
                               etc.



                             
V.   DATA (ASCII VCT00)

ASCII VCT00 data files do not contain Headers. The ASCII VCT00
files are simply as series of records, broken up into line
segments according to the pencode.

The data records are 28 ASCII characters in fixed fields, plus
computer's end-of-record indicator. There will always be at least
one space between fields, allowing the data to be input as space-
delimited data.  Decimal points for latitude and longitude are
explicit.

The plotting instructions (MoveTo or LineTo) are contained within
the Pencode Field. The Pencode also contains resolution
information. Each Non-Zero pencode value is evenly divisible by a
number of Resolution Values, meaning that the lat/lon point
"belongs" to those particular resolutions.  This Resolution Value
is one of the first 7 prime numbers, the value of which increases
with lower Resolution. To plot at a particular resolution you
would only plot those points which have a Pencode which is evenly
divisible by your particular Resolution Value. For full
resolution this Resolution Value would be 1. The remaining
Resolution Values increase through the Prime Numbers as the
desired resolution decreases (i.e. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13). Thus a
simple Modulus Function can be used to determine whether to plot
specific point.  The usable resolutions can be thought of as
Full, High, Medium-High, Medium, Medium-Low, Low, Crude.

     The following is a detailed description of the ASCII Data
Record fields


FIELD NAME     NUMBER OF BYTES     DESCRIPTION
________________________________________________________

Longitude         11          Longitude of the point,
                              with precision up to 6 decimals.

Latitude          11          Latitude of the point,
                              with precision up to 6 decimals.

Pencode            6          Delineates the flow of the segments
                              0 - Start, MoveTo Pt (Pen up Move)
                              1 - Full Res, LineTo Pt (Pen Down Move)
                              Factor of 2 - Second Level Res LineTo Pt
                              Factor of 3 - Third Level Res LineTo Pt
                              Factor of 5 - Fourth Level Res LineTo Pt
                              etc.
