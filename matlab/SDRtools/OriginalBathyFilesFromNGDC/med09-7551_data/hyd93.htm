I.   INTRODUCTION

     During 1993 the National Geophysical Data Center decided to
integrate it's collection of National Ocean Service hydrographic 
survey data into the already existing GEODAS (GEOphysical
DAta System) data managment system.  In doing this NGDC created
an exchange format for disseminating this data.  As can be
seen below, the HYD93 format was patterned after the ever popular 
MGD77 exchange format.  This allowed relatively easy assimilation
of the data into the GEODAS system, and a standardized software 
interface for the user.  





II.   GENERAL DESCRIPTION


     The digital format presented, and referred to as
"HYD93", is an exchange format for hydrographic survey data
(bathymetry soundings and hydrographic features)  It is intended 
to be used for the transmission of data to and from a data center
and may be useful for the exchange of data between marine 
institutions.  Data is to be exchanged in files, two files per 
survey operation (see below) or in the manner of organizing the data
at the contributing institution.  Data may be exchanged on magnetic
tape or on various mass storage devices such as tape or disks, or 
over the Internet.  The National Geophysical Data Center uses CD-ROM
disks as its chief method of distribution of these
data.

The HYD93 format was developed as an ASCII format for both the Header 
Record and the Data Records, but the Data Records can also be in 
binary form, called Binary HYD93. This format is a space-saving subset 
of the data which may have some appeal for users. Binary HYD93 is the 
format which is used to store the survey files on NGDC's hydrographic 
survey CD-ROMs.



A. Data Exchange

     1. For exchange purposes each digital HYD93 survey shall consist 
of a file containing the HYD93 Header (survey documentation) and a 
file of HYD93 data records (soundings and features). If the media is 
too small to contain all the data records a second data record file 
may be continued on a second media.

     2. A wide range of distribution methods are available.  Densities,
        blocking, byte order, and computer formats must be explicitly
        detailed.
       
       a. FTP (file transfer protocol) in ASCII or compressed form.
       
       b. Magnetic 8mm tape in UNIX tar format or ASCII format.
       
       c. Mass storage files on media such as floppy disks, 
          CD-ROM Write-Once media , removable magnetic/optical
          disks, etc.
          




III.                  THE HEADER RECORD


     The purpose of the Header Record is to document both
the content and structure of the hydrographic data contained
within the data records.  In general, documentation that is
constant throughout the survey will be in the Header Record,
while documentation that is variable will be in the Data ReCords.

     On mass storage media, the HYD93 Header consists of a file
of 24 80-character sequential records.  For magnetic tapes the
HYD93 Header is a file of one physical record (block) consisting
of 1,920 characters. 

     The Header Record contains fields which are both fixed
and freely formatted.  All field lengths within the Header
that have not been coded with information should be blank-
filled, and all plain language statements should be left-
justified.  The Header consists of a "sequence" of twenty-
four 80-character images.


Format Conventions for the Header Record:
1. All decimal points are explicit characters in the Header

2. Leading zeros and blanks are equivalent.

3. Unknown or unused fields are to be blank filled.

The following is a detailed description of the Header Record.  
Fields can be of type integer, real or character.  Fields that 
represent whole numbers are integers  Fields that contain a 
decimal component are real, and fields that are alphanumeric 
are character.

IV.                    THE DATA RECORD


     Each data record presents a bathymetric sounding value or
hydrographic feature value with corresponding position, value
type, and cartographic code.

Format Conventions:

     1. All decimal points are implied (e.g. 1234 in 10ths of units means 123.4)
     
     2. Leading zeros and blanks are equivalent.
     
     3. Unknown or unused values are filled with 9's.

     4. All Bathymetric Sounding (non-feature) data records include
        a known depth value, a value type of 0 (actual depth) and a
        cartographic code of 711 (Sounding in meters and tenths).
        
     5. Negative depth values indicate elevations.
        
     6. Hydrograpic Feature records with non-zero Value Type may
        or may not have a known (non 9's) value.
        
     7. Hydrographic Feature which are "Line Features" do not include
        depths. Instead the depth value fields are used for the sequence
        numbers each record along the line feature (1...n).

The following is a detailed description of the Data Record.  
Fields can be of type integer, real or character.  Fields that represent 
whole numbers are integers  Fields that contain a decimal component are 
real (the decimal point is always implied), and fields that are alphanumeric 
are character.

IV.                    THE DATA RECORD (Binary HYD93)

HYD93 Binary Format is a binary representation of the HYD93 data record.
It is the format in which files are stored on NGDC's hydrographic 
survey CD-ROM sets.  The fields included in this format are binary 
representations of some of the fields in the HYD93 ASCII data record.

Each data record presents a bathymetric sounding value or hydrographic 
feature value with corresponding position, value type, and cartographic 
code.  The survey id, which occurs in the ASCII HYD93 data record, is 
absent in HYD93 Binary Records

Format Conventions for the Binary Data Record:

     1. Unknown or unused fields have a value of 9's:
        unknown depth = 999999
        unknown type/carto-code = 9999

     2. All Bathymetric Sounding (non-feature) data records include
        a known depth value, a value type of 0 (actual depth) and a
        cartographic code of 711 (Sounding in meters and tenths).
        
     3. Negative depth values indicate elevations.
        
     4. Hydrograpic Feature records with non-zero Type may
        or may not have a known (non 9's) value.

     5. Hydrographic Feature which are "Line Features" do not include
        depths. Instead the depth value fields are used for the sequence
        numbers each record along the line feature (1...n).



Field Name              Number Type      Description        
____________________________________________________________

LATITUDE X 1,000,000    4 Byte Integer   Latitude in millionths of degrees
                                         +=North; -=South   

LONGITUDE X 1,000,000   4 Byte Integer   Longitude in millionths of degrees 
                                         +=East; -=West
  
DEPTH VALUE X 10        4 Byte Integer   Depth in tenths of meters
                                         (or Line Feature sequence number)
TYPE/CARTO CODE         2 Byte Integer   type-code * 1000 + carto-code*


*type/carto code combines the type code field with the carto code field by 
multiplying the type times 1000 and adding the carto code. e.g. a type code 
of 3 and a carto-code of 123 computes to a TYPE/CARTO CODE value of 3124.
