GEODAS Design-a-Grid File Retrieval readme 4/29/2004

This describes custom grid data you downloaded to your computer using the
GEODAS On-line Design-a-Grid System.

After uncompressing, all the downloaded files will be in a base folder named
[Grid Id]_data.

In the base folder there is a help file (help.htm) which you can open
in your browser. This contains information about the grid(s) and GEODAS
Software. Especially important are details about the grid format(s).

Under the base folder there is a folder named as Grid Id. In this folder
you will find the grid file(s) you created on-line. Possible files are:

[Grid Id].g98 Binary Raster GRD98 Grid File (includes GRD98 Header)
[Grid Id].asc ASCII Raster Grid File (may include Arc Header)
[Grid Id].bin Binary Raster Grid File (may include separate Arc Header file)
[Grid Id].xyz Longitude,Latitude,Depth Grid (may include separate Arc Header file)
[Grid Id].hdr Arc style ASCII Header for use with Binary Raster or XYZ Grid Files

You may use GEODAS programs Grid Translator, Hydro-Plot (Windows and Linux-X86),
and Coastline Extractor after installing the software. (Grid Translator create 
custom grid from downloaded GRD98 Formatted grids.) Find the software under the 
setup folder or, if you did not include the software (or GEODAS Coastlines) you
can obtain the latest versions at:

  www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/gdas/gx_announce.Html

If you wish to copy this data to a CD/DVD, and access it with GEODAS Software,
burn everything beneath the base folder ([Grid Id]_grid) onto the CD/DVD, but
without including the base folder itself (file cdrdas.vol must be at the root
of the CD/DVD.


Please let me know if you have any problems with this data or software, or if
you need any more information.
