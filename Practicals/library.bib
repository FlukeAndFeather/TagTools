abstract = {Previous sound recordings of resident (fish-eating) killer whale groups have revealed matrilineal group-specific call repertoires and a strong tendency for calls of the same type to be produced in series. Vocal interactions between individual free-ranging animals, however, have remained unexplored because it has not been possible to identify signallers reliably with a single hydrophone. Here we link acoustic arrivals of calls on a towed hydrophone array with visual tracking of photo-identified individuals to ascribe calls to a focal animal when it was separated from other members of its matrilineal group by more than 35 m, and thereby out of visual range. We confirm that individual members of a matrilineal group share a repertoire of stereotyped calls, and we statistically examine timing of stereotyped calls produced by one individual relative to calls produced by other members of its group. Analysis of the intervals between stereotyped calls indicated that calls were produced in group bouts with a criterion interval of 19.6 s separating bouts. We were therefore careful to develop randomization tests that preserved call interval structure. Focal whales produced 36{\%} of their calls within 5 s of a call from a nonfocal animal, four times more calls than expected by chance based upon a rotation randomization test. Consecutive calls produced by different individuals during group-calling bouts matched call type more than expected by chance. Vocal exchanges of stereotyped calls with type matching appear to be an important aspect of intragroup calling in killer whales, although the function of this calling behaviour remains to be explored.

abstract = {Pseudoreplication is the failure of a statistical analysis to properly incorporate the true structure of randomness present in the data. It has been well documented and studied in the ecological literature but has received little attention in the fisheries literature. Avoiding pseudoreplication in analyses of fisheries data can be difficult due to the complexity of the statistical procedures required. However, recent developments in statistical methodology are decreasing the extent to which pseudoreplication has to be tolerated. Seven examples are given here, beginning with simple design-based remedies and progressing to more challenging examples including the model-based remedies of mixed-effects modelling, generalized linear mixed models, state-space models, and geostatistics.},

abstract = {Animal movement, as measured by the overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), has recently been shown to correlate well with energy expenditure. However, accelerometers measure a summed acceleration derived from 2 components: static (due to gravity) and dynamic (due to motion). Since only the dynamic component is necessary for the calculation of ODBA, there is a need to establish a robust method for determining dynamic acceleration, currently done by substracting static values from the total acceleration. This study investigated the variability in ODBA arising from deriving static acceleration by smoothing total acceleration over different durations. ODBA was calculated for 3 different modes of locomotion within 1 species (the imperial shag) and for swimming in 4 species of marine vertebrates that varied considerably in body size. ODBA was found to vary significantly with the length of the running mean. Furthermore, the variability of ODBA across running means appeared to be related to the stroke period and hence body size. The results suggest that the running mean should be taken over a minimum period of 3 s for species with a dominant stroke period of up to this value. For species with a dominant stroke period above 3 s, it is suggested that static acceler-ation be derived over a period of no less than 1 stroke cycle.},

abstract = {Acoustic analyses of primate vocalizations as well as playback experiments are staple methods in primatology. Acoustic analyses have been used to investigate the influence of factors such as individuality, context, sex, age, and size on variation in calls. More recent studies have expanded our knowledge on the effects of phylogenetic relatedness and the structure of primate vocal repertoires in general. Complementary playback experiments allow direct testing of hypotheses regarding the attribution of meaning to calls, the cognitive mechanisms underpinning responses, and/or the adaptive value of primate behavior. After briefly touching on the historical background of this field of research, we first provide an introduction to recording primate vocalizations and discuss different approaches to describe primate calls in terms of their temporal and spectral properties. Second, we present a tutorial regarding the preparation, execution, and interpretation of field playback experiments, including a review of studies that have used such approaches to investigate the responses to acoustic variation in calls including the integration of contextual and acoustic information, recognition of kin and social relationships, and social knowledge. Based on the review of the literature and our own experience, we make a number of recommendations regarding the most common problems and pitfalls. The power of acoustic analyses typically hinges on the quality of the recordings and the number of individuals represented in the sample. Playback experiments require profound knowledge of the natural behavior of the animals for solid interpretation; experiments should be conducted sparingly, to avoid habituation of the subjects to the occurrence of the calls; experimenter-blind designs chosen whenever possible; and researchers should brace themselves for long periods of waiting times until the appropriate moments to do the experiment arise. If all these aspects are considered, acoustic analyses and field playback experiments provide unique insights into primate communication and cognition.},

abstract = {Echolocating bats of the genus Rousettus produce click sonar signals, using their tongue (lingual echolocation). These signals are often considered rudimentary and are believed to enable only crude performance. However, the main argument supporting this belief, namely the click's reported long duration, was recently shown to be an artifact. In fact, the sonar clicks of Rousettus bats are extremely short, {\~{}}50-100 $\mu$s, similar to dolphin vocalizations. Here, we present a comparison between the sonar systems of the 'model species' of laryngeal echolocation, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), and that of lingual echolocation, the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). We show experimentally that in tasks, such as accurate landing or detection of medium-sized objects, click-based echolocation enables performance similar to laryngeal echolocators. Further, we describe a sophisticated behavioral strategy for biosonar beam steering in clicking bats. Finally, theoretical analyses of the signal design-focusing on their autocorrelations and wideband ambiguity functions-predict that in some aspects, such as target ranging and Doppler-tolerance, click-based echolocation might outperform laryngeal echolocation. Therefore, we suggest that click-based echolocation in bats should be regarded as a viable echolocation strategy, which is in fact similar to the biosonar used by most echolocating animals, including whales and dolphins.},

abstract = {Cetaceans rely critically on sound for navigation, foraging and communication and are therefore potentially affected by increasing noise levels from human activities at sea. Shipping is the main contributor of anthropogenic noise underwater, but studies of shipping noise effects have primarily considered baleen whales due to their good hearing at low frequencies, where ships produce most noise power. Conversely, the possible effects of vessel noise on small toothed whales have been largely ignored due to their poor low-frequency hearing. Prompted by recent findings of energy at medium- to high-frequencies in vessel noise, we conducted an exposure study where the behaviour of four porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) in a net-pen was logged while they were exposed to 133 vessel passages. Using a multivariate generalised linear mixed-effects model, we show that low levels of high frequency components in vessel noise elicit strong, stereotyped behavioural responses in porpoises. Such low levels will routinely be experienced by porpoises in the wild at ranges of more than 1000 meters from vessels, suggesting that vessel noise is a, so far, largely overlooked, but substantial source of disturbance in shallow water areas with high densities of both porpoises and vessels.},

abstract = {Remotely sensed tracking technology has revealed remarkable migration patterns that were previously unknown; however, models to optimally use such data have developed more slowly. Here, we present a hierarchical Bayes state-space framework that allows us to combine tracking data from a collection of animals and make inferences at both individual and broader levels. We formulate models that allow the navigation ability of animals to be estimated and demonstrate how information can be combined over many animals to allow improved estimation. We also show how formal hypothesis testing regarding navigation ability can easily be accomplished in this framework. Using Argos satellite tracking data from 14 leatherback turtles, 7 males and 7 females, during their southward migration from Nova Scotia, Canada, we find that the circle of confusion (the radius around an animal's location within which it is unable to determine its location precisely) is approximately 96 km. This estimate suggests that the turtles' navigation does not need to be highly accurate, especially if they are able to use more reliable cues as they near their destination. Moreover, for the 14 turtles examined, there is little evidence to suggest that male and female navigation abilities differ. Because of the minimal assumptions made about the movement process, our approach can be used to estimate and compare navigation ability for many migratory species that are able to carry electronic tracking devices.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial ribosomal DNA is commonly used in DNA-based dietary analyses. In such Studies, these sequences are generally assumed to be the only version present in DNA of the organism of interest. However, nuclear pseudogenes that display variable similarity to the mitochondrial versions are common in many taxa. The presence of nuclear pseudogenes that co-amplify with their mitochondrial paralogues can lead to several possible confounding interpretations when applied to estimating animal diet. Here, we investigate the occurrence of nuclear pseudogenes in fecal samples taken from bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) that were assayed for prey DNA with a universal primer technique. We found pseudogenes in 13 of 15 samples and 1-5 pseudogene haplotypes per sample representing 5-100{\%} of all amplicons produced. The proportion of amplicons that were pseudogenes and the diversity of prey DNA recovered per sample were highly variable and appear to be related to PCR cycling characteristics. This is a well-sampled system where we call reliably identify the putative pseudogenes and separate them from their mitochondrial paralogues using a number of recommended means. In many other cases, it would be virtually impossible to determine whether a putative prey sequence is actually a pseudogene derived from either the predator or prey DNA. The implications of this for DNA-based dietary studies, in general, are discussed.},

abstract = {When approaching a prey target, hats have been found to decrease the intensity of their emitted echolocation pulses, called intensity compensation. In this paper we examine whether intensity compensation in the echolocation of bats is flexible or stereotyped. We recorded the echolocation calls of Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii) while the animals attacked targets of different dimensions. Myotis daubentonii reduced the peak sound pressure level emitted by about 4dB for each halving of distance, irrespective of the target presented (mealworms and two different sizes of spheres). The absolute sound pressure level emitted by the bat is not or only a little affected by target strength. Furthermore, the decrease in emitted intensity over distance shows less scatter than the same intensity over time for the last 20 cm of target approach. The bats matched the emitted intensity to target distance equally well for the spheres (aspectin-variant target strength) as for the mealworms (aspect-dependent echo strength). We therefore conclude that intensity compensation does not rely on feedback information from received intensity, but instead follows a stereotyped pattern.},

Differences in the sound source, stimulus presentation method, wave form, and duration may partially explain these discrepancies. To determine the agreement between behavioral and auditory evoked potential (AEP) threshold estimates when these parameters are held constant, behavioral and AEP hearing tests were simultaneously conducted in a bottlenose dolphin. Measurements were made in-air, using sinusoidal amplitude-modulated tones continuously projected via a transducer coupled to the pan region of the dolphin's lower jaw. Tone trials were presented using the method of constant stimuli. Behavioral thresholds were estimated using a 50{\%} correct detection. AEP thresholds were based on the envelope following response and 50{\%} correct detection. Differences between AEP and behavioral thresholds were within +/-5 dB, except at 10 kHz (12 dB), 20 kHz (8 dB), 30 kHz (7 dB), and 150 kHz (24 dB). In general, behavioral thresholds were slightly lower, though this trend was not significant. The results demonstrate that when the test environment, sound source, stimulus wave form, duration, presentation method, and analysis are consistent, the magnitude of the differences between AEP and behavioral thresholds is substantially reduced.},

abstract = {Common dolphin, Delphinus delphis (bairdi), were monitored acoustically across a survey area of 2747 km(2) during a three month period before, during and after an oil industry two dimensional (2D) seismic reflection survey. Over 900 h of audio survey data were collected and analysed, along with GPS positional data, to reveal trends in presence and distribution of animals. The presence of dolphins was determined from vocalization events on the survey recordings. Dolphin presence was assessed by a system of percentage acoustic contact. This was highest before and after the seismic survey, with common dolphins showing a clear south-westerly skew within the survey area and a probable south-westerly migration of animals between September and December. Acoustic contact with dolphins during the seismic survey also showed a south-westerly skew within the survey area, although percentages were lower. Monitoring during the period of seismic activity was restricted to the immediate vicinity (1-2 km) of the seismic vessel, so percentage contact most likely reflects the response of dolphins to such immediate activity. The overall result suggests an avoidance reaction by common dolphins to air gun emissions, although certain observations suggest tolerance to these sounds outside a 1 km radius of the guns.},

abstract = {Studies of dolphin communication have been hindered by the difficulty of localizing sounds underwater and thus identifying vocalizing individuals. Male bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.; speckled form) in Shark Bay, Western Australia produce a vocalization we call 'pops'. Pops are narrow-band, low frequency pulses with peak energy between 300 and 3000 Hz and are typically produced in trains of 3-30 pops at rates of 6-12 pops/s. Observations on the pop vocalization and associated behavior were made as part of a long-term study of bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay. During 1987-88 seven dolphins, including three males, frequented a shallow water area where they were daily provisioned with fish by tourists and fishermen. The three males often produced pops when accompanied by single female consorts into the shallows. Fortuitously, the males often remained at the surface where pops were audible in air, enabling us to identify the popping individual. All 12 of the female consorts in the study turned in towards males at a higher rate when the males were popping than when they were not popping. All 19 occurrences of one form of aggression, 'head-jerks', were associated with pops. We conclude that pops are a threat vocalization which induces the female to remain close to the popping male during consortships.},

abstract = {Delphinids produce tonal whistles shaped by vocal learning for acoustic communication. Unlike terrestrial mammals, delphinid sound production is driven by pressurized air within a complex nasal system. It is unclear how fundamental whistle contours can be maintained across a large range of hydrostatic pressures and air sac volumes. Two opposing hypotheses propose that tonal sounds arise either from tissue vibrations or through actual whistle production from vortices stabilized by resonating nasal air volumes. Here, we use a trained bottlenose dolphin whistling in air and in heliox to test these hypotheses. The fundamental frequency contours of stereotyped whistles were unaffected by the higher sound speed in heliox. Therefore, the term whistle is a functional misnomer as dolphins actually do not whistle, but form the fundamental frequency contour of their tonal calls by pneumatically induced tissue vibrations analogous to the operation of vocal folds in terrestrial mammals and the syrinx in birds. This form of tonal sound production by nasal tissue vibrations has probably evolved in delphinids to enable impedance matching to the water, and to maintain tonal signature contours across changes in hydrostatic pressures, air density and relative nasal air volumes during dives.},

Our study also provided the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of the deterrent system during a mass die-off of alewives that occurred in Lake Ontario during late spring and early summer in 1993.

Here, we report data from 3 populations of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Japan that produce whistles transmitted efficiently through environmental ambient noise. We compared the characteristics of the ambient noise in the dolphins' habitats and the whistles produced. In habitats with less ambient noise, dolphins produced whistles at varying frequencies with greater modulations; when ambient noise was greater, dolphins produced whistles of lower frequencies with fewer frequency modulations. Examination of our results suggests that communication signals are adaptive and are selected to avoid the masking of signals and the attenuation of higher-frequency signals. Thus, ambient noise may drive the variation in whistles of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin populations.},

In eight repeated night-time passages a demersal layer of herring was recorded acoustically by a small stationary reference vessel (96 GRT), while a survey vessel (710 GRT) passed at short ranges (8-40 m). No avoidance attributable to the survey vessel was observed. We interpret vessel avoidance as a response to a perceived threat and herring are known to exhibit strong avoidance reactions to survey vessels during wintering and the spawning migration. At the spawning site, the high priority given to reproductive activities seems to overrule the avoidance responses to a passing survey vessel.},

abstract = {The costs of reproduction are expected to be higher under unfavourable conditions, so that breeding in years of low food supply should have important costs. In addition, the costs of reproduction may be contingent on the age of individuals, and young growing and old senescent individuals should suffer higher costs than the prime-age ones. We tested these predictions by investigating the costs of reproduction as a function of food availability and age in female North American red squirrels using the long-term data on survival and reproduction. We found that the costs of reproduction were independent of food supply, and we did not detect any trade-off between the current and future reproduction. We also did not detect any survival cost of reproduction for the prime-age females, but found evidence for survival costs in yearlings and old (6 years or above) females with successfully breeding individuals having a lower chance of survival compared with unsuccessful or non-breeding ones. These results supported our prediction that the costs of reproduction depended on the age of female red squirrels and were higher in young growing and old senescent individuals. Our study also indicated that, in contrast to large herbivores, heterogeneity in individual quality and viability selection in red squirrels do not affect the study of trade-offs and of the age variation in life-history traits.},

abstract = {It has recently been proposed that life-history evolution is subject to a fundamental size-dependent constraint. This constraint limits the rate at which biomass can be produced so that production per unit of body mass is inevitably slower in larger organisms than in smaller ones. Here we derive predictions for how changes in body size and production rates evolve in different lifestyles subject to this constraint. Predictions are tested by using data on the mass of neonate tissue produced per adult per year in 637 placental mammal species and are generally supported. Compared with terrestrial insectivores with generalized primitive traits, mammals that have evolved more specialized lifestyles have divergent mass-specific production rates: (i) increased in groups that specialize on abundant and reliable foods: grazing and browsing herbivores (artiodactyls, lagomorphs, perissodactyls, and folivorous rodents) and flesh-eating marine mammals (pinnipeds, cetaceans); and (ii) decreased in groups that have lifestyles with reduced death rates: bats, primates, arboreal, fossorial, and desert rodents, bears, elephants, and rhinos. Convergent evolution of groups with similar lifestyles is common, so patterns of productivity across mammalian taxa reflect both ecology and phylogeny. The overall result is that groups with different lifestyles have parallel but offset relationships between production rate and body size. These results shed light on the evolution of the fast-slow life-history continuum, suggesting that variation occurs along two axes corresponding to body size and lifestyle.},

A recent debate concerning categorization of these whistles has highlighted the on-going need for perceptual studies of whistles by dolphins. This article reviews research on dolphin whistles as well as presenting a study in which a captive, female, adult bottlenose dolphin performed a conditional matching task in which whistles produced by six wild dolphins in Sarasota Bay were each paired with surrogate producers, specific objects/places. The dolphin subject also categorized unfamiliar exemplars produced by the whistlers represented by the original stimuli. The dolphin successfully discriminated among the group of whistles, associated them with surrogate producers, grouped new exemplars of the same dolphin's whistle together when the contour was intact, and discriminated among same-contour whistles produced by the same dolphin. Whistle sequences that included partial contours were not categorized with the original whistlers. Categorization appeared to be based on contour rather than specific acoustic parameters or voice cues. These findings are consistent with the perceptual tenets associated with the signature whistle framework which suggests that dolphins use individualized whistle contours for identification of known conspecifics.},

abstract = {Resident killer whales off British Columbia form four acoustically distinct clans, each with a unique dialect of discrete pulsed calls. Three clans belong to the northern and one to the southern community. Resident killer whales also produce tonal whistles, which play an important role in close-range communication within the northern community. However, there has been no comparative analysis of repertoires of whistles across clans. We investigated the structural characteristics, stability and group specificity of whistles in resident killer whales off British Columbia. Acoustic recordings and behavioural observations were made between 1978 and 2003. Whistles were classified spectrographically and additional observers were used to confirm our classification. Whistles were compared across clans using discriminant function analysis. We found 11 types of stereotyped whistles in the northern and four in the southern community with some of the whistle types being stable over at least 13 years. In northern residents, 10 of the 11 whistle types were structurally identical in two of the three acoustic clans, whereas the whistle types of southern residents differed clearly from those of the northern residents. Our study shows that killer whales that have no overlap in their call repertoire use essentially the same set of stereotyped whistles. Shared stereotyped whistles might provide a community-level means of recognition that facilitates association and affiliation of members of different clans, which otherwise use distinct signals. We further suggest that vocal learning between groups plays an important role in the transmission of whistle types.},

abstract = {The paper reviews current knowledge of intensity and directionality of bat echolocation signals. Recent studies have revealed that echolocating bats can be much louder than previously believed. Bats previously dubbed "whispering" can emit calls with source levels up to 110 dB SPL at 10 cm and the louder open space hunting bats have been recorded at above 135 dB SPL. This implies that maximum emitted intensities are generally 30 dB or more above initial estimates. Bats' dynamic control of acoustic features also includes the intensity and directionality of their sonar calls. Aerial hawking bats will increase signal directionality in the field along with intensity thus increasing sonar range. During the last phase of prey pursuit, vespertilionid bats broaden their echolocation beam considerably, probably to counter evasive maneuvers of eared prey. We highlight how multiple call parameters (frequency, duration, intensity, and directionality of echolocation signals) in unison define the search volume probed by bats and in turn how bats perceive their surroundings. Small changes to individual parameters can, in combination, drastically change the bat's perception, facilitating successful navigation and food acquisition across a vast range of ecological niches. To better understand the function of echolocation in the natural habitat it is critical to determine multiple acoustic features of the echolocation calls. The combined (interactive) effects, not only of frequency and time parameters, but also of intensity and directionality, define the bat's view of its acoustic scene.},

An array of seven Bruel and Kjaer 8103 hydrophones connected to an amplifier-line driver module was used to measure the beam patterns. The porpoise was trained to station in a hoop and echolocate a cylindrical target located at a range between 7 and 9 m while the array was located 2 m in front of the hoop. The 3-dB beamwidth in both the vertical and horizontal planes was the same at approximately 16 degrees and the beam was pointed toward the forward direction. The individual hydrophones in both the vertical and horizontal arrays measured signal waveforms that were similar throughout the 40-degree span of the array. The porpoise emitted signals with intervals that were 20 to 35 ms longer than the round trip travel time between the animal and the target. The average source level, peak frequency, and bandwidth were 157 dB, 128 kHz, and 16 kHz,.respectively. (C) 1999 Acoustical Society of America. [S0001-4966(99)01812-3].},

abstract = {Adding acoustic systems onto ocean moorings and observatories provides additional data to more fully document ecosystem responses to environmental perturbations. A passive acoustic recorder and three-frequency echosounder system were integrated into a biophysical mooring on the central eastern Bering Sea continental shelf. An unexpected, transient, mid-winter retreat of the seasonal sea ice was observed over the mooring for a 2-week period in March 2009. Interpretation of the passive acoustic data provided information about sea ice conditions and included the detection and identification of vocalizing marine mammals, while the acoustic backscatter provided information on relative zooplankton and fish abundance before, during, and after the retreat. Hydrographic data confirmed the acoustic signal was associated with changing surface ice conditions, and the combined information from the biophysical mooring sensors revealed changes in winter trophic level dynamics during the retreat, which would have otherwise been undetected by traditional ship-based observations. Changes in the acoustic environment, zooplankton dynamics, and acoustic detection of marine mammals were observed amidst a physically stable and uniform water column with no indication of a phytoplankton bloom. These data demonstrate the value of acoustic technologies to monitor changing ecosystems dynamics in remote and hazardous locations.},

abstract = {Mass stranding of several species of beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) associated with exposure to anthropogenic sounds has raised concern for the conservation of these species. However, little is known about the species' life histories, prey or habitat requirements. Without this knowledge, it becomes difficult to assess the effects of anthropogenic sound, since there is no way to determine whether the disturbance is impacting the species' physical or environmental requirements. Here we take a bioenergetics approach to address this gap in our knowledge, as the elusive, deep-diving nature of beaked whales has made it hard to study these effects directly. We develop a model for Ziphiidae linking feeding energetics to the species' requirements for survival and reproduction, since these life history traits would be the most likely to be impacted by non-lethal disturbances. Our models suggest that beaked whale reproduction requires energy dense prey, and that poor resource availability would lead to an extension of the inter-calving interval. Further, given current information, it seems that some beaked whale species require relatively high quality habitat in order to meet their requirements for survival and reproduction. As a result, even a small non-lethal disturbance that results in displacement of whales from preferred habitats could potentially impact a population if a significant proportion of that population was affected. We explored the impact of varying ecological parameters and model assumptions on survival and reproduction, and find that calf and fetus survival appear more readily affected than the survival of adult females.},

abstract = {Toothed whales (Cetacea, odontoceti) emit sound pulses to probe their surroundings by active echolocation. Noninvasive, acoustic Dtags were placed on deep-diving Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) to record their ultrasonic clicks and the returning echoes from prey items, providing a unique view on how a whale operates its biosonar during foraging in the wild. The process of echolocation during prey capture in this species can be divided into search, approach and terminal phases, as in echolocating bats. The approach phase, defined by the onset of detectable echoes recorded on the tag for click sequences terminated by a buzz, has interclick intervals (ICI) of 300-400 ms. These ICIs are more than a magnitude longer than the decreasing two-way travel time to the targets, showing that ICIs are not given by the two-way-travel times plus a fixed, short lag time. During the approach phase, the received echo energy increases by 10.4((+/-)2) dB when the target range is halved, demonstrating that the whales do not employ range compensating gain control of the transmitter, as has been implicated for some bats and dolphins. The terminal/buzz phase with ICIs of around 10 ms is initiated when one or more targets are within approximately a body length of the whale (2-5 m), so that strong echo returns in the approach phase are traded for rapid updates in the terminal phase. It is suggested that stable ICIs in the search and approach phases facilitate auditory scene analysis in a complex multi-target environment, and that a concomitant low click rate allows the whales to maintain high sound pressure outputs for prey detection and discrimination with a pneumatically driven, bi-modal sound generator. demonstrating that the whales do not employ range-compensating gain control of the transmitter, as has been implicated for some bats and dolphins.

abstract = {We describe an integrative approach to studying the fine-scale distribution of harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena in the Bay of Fundy, using satellite telemetry, line transect surveys and remote sensing techniques. Analysis of satellite telemetry data from 6 porpoises (5 male, I female) revealed that over the course of a month individuals ranged across large areas (7738 to 11289 km(2)) but concentrated their movements in small focal regions (August mean = 294 km(2), September mean = 252 km(2)), often proximate to islands, headlands, or restricted channels. Line transect surveys (n = 25 flood tide, n = 20 ebb tide) in the focal region of 2 tagged animals revealed that relative porpoise density (animals km(-2)) was significantly greater during flood (9.59) than ebb tide phases (1.79). Hydro-acoustic prey surveys revealed aggregations of prey along localized fronts in this region. Remote sensing images indicated the presence of an island wake in the focal region during flood tides, providing an ecological context for our observations of high densities of porpoises. Remote sensing revealed the existence of a headland wake in the focal region of another porpoise near Campobello Island. These results support the hypothesis that regions of enhanced relative vorticity, like island and headland wakes, aggregate prey and represent important foraging habitat for harbour porpoises in the Bay of Fundy.},

@article{Townsend2012,
abstract = {Flexible vocal production has been demonstrated in several vertebrate species, with much work focusing on the role of the social "audience" in explaining variation in call production. It is, however, likely that the decision to call is an emergent property of both external and internal factors, and the extent to which these factors are integrated has been little investigated. We addressed this question by examining the production of alarm calls in wild male meerkats (Suricata suricatta) in different social environments and different predator-encounter contexts. Males searching for reproductive opportunities (rovers) were followed 1) in their home group and when prospecting either 2) solitarily or 3) in a coalition with other males. Results showed that conspecific presence influenced the production of flee-alarm and recruitment calls. Solitary rovers were less likely to produce flee-alarm calls compared with when they are with conspecifics, whether coalitionary rovers or the rover's home group. Experimentally elicited recruitment calls were also produced less when males were solitary than when in their home group. Bark vocalizations, emitted when meerkats were safe, were always produced irrespective of conspecific presence, indicating that these calls function to address predators. The probability of producing flee alarms also increased with the urgency of the predation event. Our results indicate that variation in alarm call production depends on whom the call is addressed to and also on the motivational state of the caller. We argue that neglecting to integrate internal and external factors when elucidating mechanisms underlying vocal production can potentially lead to misguided, parsimonious conclusions regarding vocal flexibility in animals.},

abstract = {We studied interactions between tourists and free-ranging bottlenose dolphins in an artificial feeding program at Monkey Mia, Australia. We used logistic regression to identify factors that contributed to the incidence of "risky" (potentially injurious) interactions between tourists and dolphins. Rates of dolphin-to-tourist risky interactions were heightened with longer waiting times before dolphins were fed. We documented differences among provisioned dolphins in their proclivity to engage in risky interactions; however, it was more likely for risky interactions to be initiated by tourists. Our findings suggest several readily implemented management strategies to reduce incidence of risky interactions. Long-term monitoring of tourism based on artificial feeding is essential to identify and rectify detrimental effects of provisioning on dolphins, to ensure the safety and welfare of dolphins and tourists, and to promote sustainability of this potentially harmful tourist activity.

abstract = {Baleen whales and Adelie penguins in the near-shore waters around the Antarctic Peninsula forage principally on Antarctic krill. Given the spatial overlap in the distribution of these krill predators (particularly humpback whales) and their dependence on krill, the goals of this paper are to determine if the inter-annual community structure and relative abundance of baleen whales around Anvers Island is related to krill demography and abundance, and if the potential exists for inter-specific interactions between Adelie penguins and baleen. We use whale sightings and prey data from both net tows and Adelie penguin stomach samples to correlate the abundance of humpback whales with krill demography and abundance from 1993 to 2001. We find significant relationships between whale abundance and the size-frequency distribution of krill targeted by Adelie penguins, as well as the foraging success of Adelie penguins. These findings suggest both krill predators share common prey preferences in the upper portions of the water column around Anvers Island. These findings highlight the need for better knowledge of baleen whale foraging ecology and inter-specific interactions with penguins, as sea ice and krill populations around the Antarctic Peninsula are affected by rapid changes in climate.},

abstract = {Blue whale songs provide a measure for characterising worldwide blue whale population structure. These songs are divided into nine regional types, which maintain a stable character. Five of the nine song types have been recorded over time spans greater than 30 years showing no significant change in character. The nine song types can be divided into those containing only simple tonal components (high latitude North Pacific, North Atlantic and Southern Ocean song types), those comprised of complex pulsed units in addition to the tonal components (Pacific Ocean margin song types from California, Chile and New Zealand), and those which have the greatest complexity of all and the longest cycling times (Indian Ocean song types from Sri Lanka, Fremantle and Diego Garcia). We suggest that temporally stable differences in song provide another characteristic for comparison with genetic and morphological data when defining blue whale populations. Furthermore, as Mellinger and Barlow (2003) recommend, when there is a lack of other data or lack of clarity in other data sets, evidence of distinct differences in songs between areas should be used as a provisional hypothesis about population structure when making management decisions. Worldwide study is needed to better understand the various populations and subspecies within species like the blue whale that have large geographic distributions and have both migrating and resident populations.},

abstract = {Evolutionary responses to the long-term exploitation of individuals from a population may include reduced growth rate, age at maturation, body size and productivity. Theoretical models suggest that these genetic changes may be slow or impossible to reverse but rigorous empirical evidence is lacking. Here, we provide the first empirical demonstration of a genetically based reversal of fishing-induced evolution. We subjected six populations of silverside fish () to three forms of size-selective fishing for five generations, thereby generating twofold differences among populations in mean weight and yield (biomass) at harvest. This was followed by an additional five generations during which size-selective harvest was halted. We found that evolutionary changes were reversible. Populations evolving smaller body size when subjected to size-selective fishing displayed a slow but significant increase in size when fishing ceased. Neither phenotypic variance in size nor juvenile survival was reduced by the initial period of selective fishing, suggesting that sufficient genetic variation remained to allow recovery. By linear extrapolation, we predict full recovery in about 12 generations, although the rate of recovery may taper off near convergence. The recovery rate in any given wild population will also depend on other agents of selection determined by the specifics of life history and environment. By contrast, populations that in the first five generations evolved larger size and yield showed little evidence of reversal. These results show that populations have an intrinsic capacity to recover genetically from harmful evolutionary changes caused by fishing, even without extrinsic factors that reverse the selection gradient. However, harvested species typically have generation times of 3{\^{a}}€“7 years, so recovery may take decades. Hence, the need to account for evolution in managing fisheries remains.},

abstract = {The Baird's or giant beaked whale ( Berardius bairdii ) is endemic to the North Pacific Ocean. In the eastern North Pacific, seasonal movements are poorly understood. Historic California catches suggest two peaks of abundance, in July and October. Mass strandings of Baird's beaked whales are rare. Prior to this report only two records were known, in the Bay of La Paz, Mexico in 1986 and Sagami Bay, Japan, in 1987; both mass strandings included male and females. Here we report a mass stranding of 10 Baird's beaked whales at San Jose lsland in the Gulf of California on 31 July 2006. The group was composed only by males ranging from 9.97m to 11.05m. The estimated age, based on the dental group layers, ranged from 9 to 42 years. The cause of this stranding is unknown, although with the large number of squid also found dead in the area, it is possible that the whales could have been following the squid, one of their main prey. The mass stranding of 10 mature males reported here supports the idea of a seasonal presence, during summer, of this species in the waters of the southwest Gulf of California. The group composition supports a reproductive strategy where the old males have a major role in the guidance and protection of inexperienced weaned and young males, unlike sperm whale bachelor groups, where all males are typically the same age.},

abstract = {Although genetic information is acquired only once, cultural information can be both abandoned and reacquired during an individual's lifetime. Therefore, cultural evolution will be determined not only by cultural traits' ability to spread but also by how good they are at sticking with an individual; however, the evolutionary consequences of this aspect of culture have not previously been explored. Here we show that repeated learning and multiple characteristics of cultural traits make cultural evolution unique, allowing dynamical phenomena we can recognize as specifically cultural, such as traits that both spread quickly and disappear quickly. Importantly, the analysis of our model also yields a theoretical objection to the popular suggestion that biological and cultural evolution can be understood in similar terms. We find that the possibility to predict long-term cultural evolution by some success index, analogous to biological fitness, depends on whether individuals have few or many opportunities to learn. If learning opportunities are few, we find that the existence of a success index may be logically impossible, rendering notions of {\^{a}}€{\oe}cultural fitness{\^{a}}€  meaningless. On the other hand, if individuals can learn many times, we find a success index that works, regardless of whether the transmission pattern is vertical, oblique, or horizontal.},

abstract = {Simple cupular organs similar to those described in Ciona intestinalis were observed in Corella eumyota. They consist of a macula containing the cell bodies of 20201330 primary sensory neurons whose cilia project into a dome- or finger-shaped structure, the cupula. Rather than being found in the mantle lining as in C. intestinalis, the organs were located on the atrial surface of the branchial sac. The sensory innervation was examined in whole-mount preparations using anti-tubulin immunohistochemistry. Sensory neurons in C. eumyota showed no immunoreactivity with antisera raised against gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). A novel, elongated sense organ termed the cupular strand was found in Corella inflata. It has the same basic components as the simple type of cupular organ but consists of a single, long structure containing 223C1500 sensory cells. Located on the atrial surface of the branchial sac, it extends along the midline of the dorsal fold, from the gonoduct openings almost as far as the brain. Preparations were examined using optical and electron microscopy. Nerves and cilia were visualized by anti-tubulin immunofluorescence microscopy. It was possible to follow the sensory axons from the macula of the cupular strand to points where they joined branches of the visceral nerve, which enters a nerve root at the back of the brain. In C. inflata the sensory cell bodies and their axons were immunoreactive not only with anti-tubulin but also with an antiserum raised against Tunicate I GnRH. There was no immunoreactivity, however, with Chicken II and catfish GnRH antisera. All three GnRH antisera labeled the dorsal strand plexus, a structure associated with production of GnRH in its role as a reproductive hormone. We concluded that the GnRH-like molecule labeled in sensory neurons differs from the form of GnRH found in the dorsal strand plexus, and may have a different function, perhaps in the neural control of ciliary activity. The function of the cupular organs in species of Corella has not yet been investigated physiologically, but by analogy with such structures in other metazoans, cupular organs are probably hydrodynamic sensors registering local disturbances or changes in water flow through the atrial cavity.},

abstract = {Digital tags were used to describe diving and vocal behaviour of sperm whales during 198 complete and partial foraging dives made by 37 individual sperm whales in the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Ligurian Sea. The maximum depth of dive averaged by individual differed across the three regions and was 985 m (SD = 124.3), 644 m (123.4) and 827 m (60.3), respectively. An average dive cycle consisted of a 45 min (6.3) dive with a 9 min (3.0) surface interval, with no significant differences among regions. On average, whales spent greater than 72{\%} of their time in foraging dive cycles. Whales produced regular clicks for 81{\%} (4.1) of a dive and 64{\%} (14.6) of the descent phase. The occurrence of buzz vocalizations (also called 'creaks') as an indicator of the foraging phase of a dive showed no difference in mean prey capture attempts per dive between regions [18 buzzes/dive (7.6)]. Sperm whales descended a mean of 392 m (144) from the start of regular clicking to the first buzz, which supports the hypothesis that regular clicks function as a long-range biosonar. There were no significant differences in the duration of the foraging phase [28 min (6.0)] or percentage of the dive duration in the foraging phase [62{\%} (7.3)] between the three regions, with an overall average proportion of time spent actively encountering prey during dive cycles of 0.53 (0.05). Whales maintained their time in the foraging phase by decreasing transit time for deeper foraging dives. Similarity in foraging behaviour in the three regions and high diving efficiencies suggest that the success of sperm whales as mesopelagic predators is due in part to long-range echolocation of deep prey patches, efficient locomotion and a large aerobic capacity during diving.},

abstract = {Previous attempts at localizing cetaceans have generally used multiple hydrophone arrays and multichannel recording systems. In this paper, a low-budget localization technique using only one hydrophone is described. The time delays of the signals traveling via the surface and bottom reflection paths to the hydrophone, relative to the direct signal, are used to calculate the distance and the depth of a phonating animal. Only two additional measures, the depth of the bottom and hydrophone, have to be taken. The method requires relatively shallow waters and a flat bottom surface. Echolocating and burst pulsing Hawaiian spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) st the Waianae coast of Oahu, Hawaii, were localized over different bottom substrates. A tracking range of up to 100 m was achieved. The accuracy of the method is estimated by the total error differential technique. The relative distance estimation error is below 35{\%} and the absolute depth error below 0.7 m, so that the location method is sufficiently precise for examining source levels in our study area. Because of its simplicity, the method ideally complements sound recordings and visual sightings of marine mammals and could lead to a better understanding of the nature and use of click trains by dolphins.

abstract = {Abstract: Resident killer whales off Vancouver Island, British Columbia, produce variable burst pulsedcalls most commonly during close-range interactions such as socialising or social-travelling. Earlier studies indicated that variable calls are graded and can be arranged into a scale from low-frequency calls to high-frequency ones. These graded calls are often emitted in sequences, were call-classes of similar frequency follow one another more often than different classes. However, a detailed analysis of sequences was lacking to date. Therefore, our understanding of the function of variable calls during interactions among killer whales is rather limited. Simultaneous recordings of underwater vocalizations and behavioural observations from resident killer whales were collected off Vancouver Island, British Columbia during1996-2001. Socialising activities were divided into four categories: male-female, male-male, female-juvenile and juvenile-juvenile. Variable call sequences were analysed with RTS and SIGNAL acoustic-software. We found no positive correlation between group-size and number of used calls or the duration of sequences, indicating that only one or a few animals were involved in the production of each sequence. Furthermore, sequences were present in all four behaviour categories and the composition of the group had no influence on the duration of calls and used call-classes. One particular call class (V4) could be further separated into structurally distinct sub-classes. These sub-classes often formed rather stereotyped sequences. The results of our study indicate that sequences of variable calls emit broad motivational information that is not age or sex-related. Sequences of distinct sub-classes might encode more subtle information on emotional states during socialising. Therefore, variable calls might posses different functions, depending on the nature of the interaction. Thus, variable calls might be of great importance for close-range communication in wild killer whales.  },

abstract = {The ability of bats and toothed whales to echolocate is a remarkable case of convergent evolution. Previous genetic studies have documented parallel evolution of nucleotide sequences in Prestin and KCNQ4, both of which are associated with voltage motility during the cochlear amplification of signals. Echolocation involves complex mechanisms. The most important factors include cochlear amplification, nerve transmission, and signal re-coding. Herein, we screen three genes that play different roles in this auditory system. Cadherin 23 (Cdh23) and its ligand, protocadherin 15 (Pcdh15), are essential for bundling motility in the sensory hair. Otoferlin (Otof) responds to nerve signal transmission in the auditory inner hair cell. Signals of parallel evolution occur in all three genes in the three groups of echolocators—two groups of bats (Yangochiroptera and Rhinolophoidea) plus the dolphin. Significant signals of positive selection also occur in Cdh23 in the Rhinolophoidea and dolphin, and Pcdh15 in Yangochiroptera. In addition, adult echolocating bats have higher levels of Otof expression in the auditory cortex than do their embryos and non-echolocation bats. Cdh23 and Pcdh15 encode the upper and lower parts of tip-links, and both genes show signals of convergent evolution and positive selection in echolocators, implying that they may co-evolve to optimize cochlear amplification. Convergent evolution and expression patterns of Otof suggest the potential role of nerve and brain in echolocation. Our synthesis of gene sequence and gene expression analyses reveals that positive selection, parallel evolution, and perhaps co-evolution and gene expression affect multiple hearing genes that play different roles in audition, including voltage and bundle motility in cochlear amplification, nerve transmission, and brain function.},

abstract = {Abstract: A series of natural history factors were examined to identify which are likely to influence acoustic behaviour in male phocid seals. Contrary to traditional thought, the degree of polygyny did not appear to influence vocal repertoire size or the other acoustic features examined. However, degree of sexual dimorphism, stability of the pupping substrate and density, guard-ability and predictability of oestrus females, and function of the signals, all appear to be important.  Species pupping in stable habitats tend to have vocalizations which are low in minimum frequency, whereas pack-ice breeders have vocalizations with high minimum frequencies. In species where oestrus females are predictably distributed and guardable (the southern elephant, Mirounga leonina, northern elephant, Mirounga angustirostris, grey, Halichoerus grypus, hooded, Cystophora cristata, and crabeater, Lobodon carcinophagus, seals) the acoustic displays of the males tend to be associated with male-male agonistic interactions and are likely to be intrasexual in function. Male vocal repertoires tend to be simple in form composed of a reduced number of primarily broadband pulsed sounds following Morton's (1982) Motivational Structural Hypothesis.  However, in species where females do not remain hauled-out with their pups until weaning it is more difflcult for males to physically guard them until oestrus. If oestrus females are inaccessible to males, either because they are moving to and from the sea or because they are widely distributed, males could use vocal displays to attract a mate. When oestrus females are widely and unpredictably dispersed long-range underwater advertisement displays are necessary (Scattergun advertizing). The acoustic displays of males of these species (leopard, Hydrurga leptonyx ; Ross, Ommatophoca rossii; bearded, Erignathus barbatus; and ribbon, Histriophoca fasciata, seals) must travel long distances. Sounds that are required to travel over long distances could change slightly in character due to the differing propagation characteristics of the varying frequency components within the vocalization. The signal also could be masked by background noise. Perhaps it is easier for a listening seal to recognise a smaller number of stereotyped vocalizations. Therefore, these seals tend to have fewer, narrowband, highly stereotyped sounds used in stylized repetitive displays which helps ensure that the signal is recognized by a receiving seal at a distance.  In species where oestrus females are predictably distributed, but unguarded (Weddell, Leptonychotes weddellii; harp, Pagophilus groenlandicus; harbour, Phoca vitulina; and ringed, Phoca hispida seals) males perform shorter-range underwater advertisement displays. The signals of species advertizing to a local audience are not constrained by propagation difflculties. These species therefore adopt a large array of sound types, and include subtle variations of the same sound type, greatly increasing their overall repertoire size (Local advertizing). },

abstract = {Fish-eating "resident"-type killer whales (Orcinus orca) that frequent the coastal waters off northeastern Vancouver Island, Canada have a strong preference for chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). The whales in this region often forage along steep cliffs that extend into the water, echolocating their prey. Echolocation signals of resident killer whales were measured with a four-hydrophone symmetrical star array and the signals were simultaneously digitized at a sample rate of 500 kHz using a lunch-box PC. A portable VCR recorded the images from an underwater camera located adjacent to the array center. Only signals emanating from close to the beam axis (1185 total) were chosen for a detailed analysis. Killer whales project very broadband echolocation signals (Q equal 0.9 to 1.4) that tend to have bimodal frequency structure. Ninety-seven percent of the signals had center frequencies between 45 and 90 kHz with bandwidths between 35 and 50 kHz. The peak-to-peak source level of the echolocation signals decreased as a function of the one-way transmission loss to the array. Source levels varied between 195 and 224 dB re: 1 muPa. Using a model of target strength for chinook salmon, the echo levels from the echolocation signals are estimated for different horizontal ranges between a whale and a salmon. At a horizontal range of 100 m, the echo level should exceed an Orcinus hearing threshold at 50 kHz by over 29 dB and should be greater than sea state 4 noise by at least 9 dB. In moderately heavy rain conditions, the detection range will be reduced substantially and the echo level at a horizontal range of 40 m would be close to the level of the rain noise.

abstract = {Sound production mechanisms have been studied in two delphinid species - the harbour porpoise, Phocoena phocoena (L.), and the bottlenosed dolphin, Tursiops truncatus (Montagu). It was found that, in both species, the click sound production was coupled to a considerable pressure increase in the bony nares. The maximum pressure recorded in Phocoena was approximately 54 kPa and in Tursiops close to 81 kPa; it was equal in time and amplitude in both nares. The nasal plug muscle was found to be active up to 450 ms prior to and during sound production. Sound production without such activity was not seen. The results suggest that an identical mechanism underlies click production in both species, with pressurized air being the driving force and the nasal plug muscle having some active regulating function.Probes were inserted into the bony nares of three harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, and one bottlenosed dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, in order to record air pressure variations together with sound production. Sounds were picked up by a hydrophone manually held to the forehead of the animals. In several of the Phocoena recordings, electromyographic activity in the nasal plug muscle was also recorded.},

Overall, call similarity determined using neural networks differed significantly between different affiliation levels for both frequency components of all the call types analysed. This method distinguished calls from individuals within the same matriline better than different calls produced by a single individual and better than by chance. The calls of individuals from different matrilines were more distinctive than those within the same matriline, confirming previous studies based on group recordings. These results show that frequency contours of stereotyped calls differ among the individuals that are constantly associated with each other and use group-specific vocalizations, though across-group differences were substantially more pronounced.},

On this basis, a proper evaluation of polysomnographic data collected in clinical trials conducted to explore clinical efficacy of novel hypnotic compounds should include the assessment of sleep architecture and its drug-induced changes. This work presents a non-linear mixed-effect Markov-chain model based on multinomial logistic functions which characterize the time course of transition probabilities between sleep stages in insomniac patients treated with placebo. Polysomnography measurements were obtained from patients during one night treatment. A population approach was used to describe the time course of sleep stages (awake stage, stage 1, stage 2, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep) using a Markov-chain model. The relationship between time and individual transition probabilities between sleep stages was modelled through piecewise linear multinomial logistic functions. The identification of the model produced a good adherence of mean post-hoc estimates to the observed transition frequencies. Parameters were generally well estimated in terms of CV, shrinkage and distribution of empirical Bayes estimates around the typical values. The posterior predictive check analysis showed good consistency between model-predicted and observed sleep parameters. In conclusion, the Markov-chain model based on multinomial logistic functions provided an accurate description of the time course of sleep stages together with an assessment of the probabilities of transition between different stages.},

abstract = {Skulls of odontocetes (toothed whales, including dolphins and porpoises) are typified by directional asymmetry, particularly in elements associated with the airway. Generally, it is assumed this asymmetry is related to biosonar production. However, skull asymmetry may actually be a by-product of selection pressure for an asymmetrically positioned larynx. The odontocete larynx traverses the pharynx and is held permanently in place by a ring of muscle. This allows prey swallowing while remaining underwater without risking water entering the lungs and causing injury or death. However, protrusion of the larynx through the pharynx causes a restriction around which prey must pass to reach the stomach. The larynx and associated hyoid apparatus has, therefore, been shifted to the left to provide a larger right piriform sinus (lateral pharyngeal food channel) for swallowing larger prey items. This asymmetry is reflected in the skull, particularly the dorsal openings of the nares. It is hypothesized that there is a relationship between prey size and skull asymmetry. This relationship was examined in 13 species of odontocete cetaceans from the northeast Atlantic, including four narrow-gaped genera (Mesoplodon, Ziphius, Hyperoodon, and Kogia) and eight wide-gaped genera (Phocoena, Delphinus, Stenella, Lagenorhynchus, Tursiops, Grampus, Globicephala, and Orcinus). Skulls were examined from 183 specimens to assess asymmetry of the anterior choanae. Stomach contents were examined from 294 specimens to assess prey size. Results show there is a significant positive relationship between maximum relative prey size consumed and average asymmetry relative to skull size in odontocete species (wide-gape species: R2 = 0.642, P = 0.006; narrow-gape species: R2 = 0.909, P = 0.031). This finding provides support for the hypothesis that the directional asymmetry found in odontocete skulls is related to an aquatic adaptation enabling swallowing large, whole prey while maintaining respiratory tract protection.

abstract = {Bat echolocation calls provide remarkable examples of {\^{a}}€˜good design{\^{a}}€™ through evolution by natural selection. Theory developed from acoustics and sonar engineering permits a strong predictive basis for understanding echolocation performance. Call features, such as frequency, bandwidth, duration and pulse interval are all related to ecological niche. Recent technological breakthroughs have aided our understanding of adaptive aspects of call design in free-living bats. Stereo videogrammetry, laser scanning of habitat features and acoustic flight path tracking permit reconstruction of the flight paths of echolocating bats relative to obstacles and prey in nature. These methods show that echolocation calls are among the most intense airborne vocalizations produced by animals. Acoustic tracking has clarified how and why bats vary call structure in relation to flight speed. Bats using broadband echolocation calls adjust call design in a range-dependent manner so that nearby obstacles are localized accurately. Recent phylogenetic analyses based on gene sequences show that particular types of echolocation signals have evolved independently in several lineages of bats. Call design is often influenced more by perceptual challenges imposed by the environment than by phylogeny, and provides excellent examples of convergent evolution. Now that whole genome sequences of bats are imminent, understanding the functional genomics of echolocation will become a major challenge.},

abstract = {Repeated ocean ambient noise measurements at a shallow water (110 m) site near San Clemente Island reveal little increase in noise levels in the absence of local ships. Navy reports document ambient noise levels at this site in 1958-1959 and 1963-1964 and a seafloor recorder documents noise during 2005-2006. When noise from local ships was excluded from the 2005-2006 recordings, median sound levels were essentially the same as were observed in 1958 and 1963. Local ship noise, however, was present in 31{\%} of the recordings in 1963 but was present in 89{\%} of the recordings in 2005-2006. Median levels including local ships are 6-9 dB higher than median levels chosen from times when local ship noise was absent. Biological sounds and the sound of wind driven waves controlled ambient noise levels in the absence of local ships. The median noise levels at this site are low for an open water site due to the poor acoustic propagation and low average wind speeds. The quiet nature of this site in the absence of local ships allows correlation of wind speed to wave noise across the 10-220 Hz spectral band of this study.},

abstract = {Despite QTL mapping being a routine procedure in plant breeding, approaches that fully exploit data from multi-trait multi-environment (MTME) trials are limited. Mixed models have been proposed both for multi-trait QTL analysis and multi-environment QTL analysis, but these approaches break down when the number of traits and environments increases. We present models for an efficient QTL analysis of MTME data with mixed models by reducing the dimensionality of the genetic variance–covariance matrix by structuring this matrix using direct products of relatively simple matrices representing variation in the trait and environmental dimension. In the context of MTME data, we address how to model QTL by environment interactions and the genetic basis of heterogeneity of variance and correlations between traits and environments. We illustrate our approach with an example including five traits across eight stress trials in CIMMYT maize. We detected 36 QTLs affecting yield, anthesis-silking interval, male flowering, ear number, and plant height in maize. Our approach does not require specialised software as it can be implemented in any statistical package with mixed model facilities.},

This paper demonstrates that theory of signal detectability (TSD) methodology is applicable to bats and uses it to show that an important element of clutter limiting in Eptesicus fuscus and Noctilio leporinus is backward masking of phantom targets by the real echo from the loudspeakers used to generate them.  This information suggests that a previous estimate of the magnitude of automatic gain control (AGC) is too high, due to variable backward masking inherent in the experimental method used.  A re-examination of gain control using a masking-free method shows that it reduces auditory sensitivity by 6 to 7 dB per halving of target range, rather than 11 dB as previously thought.},

abstract = {In cetaceans' communities, interactions between individuals of different species are often observed in the wild. Yet, due to methodological and technical challenges very little is known about the mediation of these interactions and their effect on cetaceans' behavior. Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are a highly vocal species and can be both food competitors and potential predators of many other cetaceans. Thus, the interception of their vocalizations by unintended cetacean receivers may be particularly important in mediating interspecific interactions. To address this hypothesis, we conducted playbacks of killer whale vocalizations recorded during herring-feeding activity to free-ranging long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas). Using a multi-sensor tag, we were able to track the whales and to monitor changes of their movements and social behavior in response to the playbacks. We demonstrated that the playback of killer whale sounds to pilot whales induced a clear increase in group size and a strong attraction of the animals towards the sound source. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that the interception of heterospecific vocalizations can mediate interactions between different cetacean species in previously unrecognized ways.},

Levels were compared to determine if there were systematic differences in the organochlorine (OC) contaminant composition of harbour porpoises from these areas (Newfoundland, St. Lawrence, Bay of Fundy-Gulf of Maine) in the western North Atlantic. Bivariate analyses run on all 188 individuals showed both Fundy-Maine and St. Lawrence males had significantly higher levels of CHLORs, DDTs, PCBs and CHBs than Newfoundland males. Fundy-Maine males also had significantly higher levels of CHLORs and PCBs than those from the St. Lawrence and St. Lawrence males had significantly higher levels of HCHs than males from Fundy-Maine. Females from Fundy-Maine had significantly higher levels of total PCB than both St. Lawrence and Newfoundland females. Total DDT levels were significantly higher in Fundy-Maine and St. Lawrence females than those from Newfoundland. Total CHLOR values were significantly higher in Fundy-Maine than in Newfoundland females. Multivariate analysis, run on a subset consisting of 100 immature harbour porpoises showed significant differences among the group centroids on both discriminant functions (Wilks' Lambda; p {\textless} 0.001) demonstrating that these geographic groups are distinguishable based on OC levels. These results indicate that delineating the western North Atlantic harbour porpoise population into sub-populations defined as Newfoundland, Gulf of St. Lawrence and Bay of Fundy-Gulf of Maine is appropriate.},

abstract = {Comparative studies of vocal repertoires over the geographical range of a species can improve our understanding of the function and evolution of animal vocalizations. They may also help to elucidate relationships between populations, where genetic studies are missing or difficult to perform. We recorded male bearded seal vocalizations from four sites throughout their Arctic distribution. We measured 16 parameters for each vocalization and examined variability using classification tree analyses. There were four major call categories: trill, ascent, sweep and moan. Trills divided further into three subcategories: trills with ascent/plume, long trills and short trills. Not all call categories were present at all sites: the ascent occurred only in Alaska and western Canada, the sweep occurred only in Svalbard and in the High Canadian Arctic, and the trill with ascent/plume occurred at all sites except Svalbard. Geographical differences between sites were apparent in repertoire size as well as in vocal structure. Furthermore, an east-west gradient in structural similarities between call types was apparent. The vocal repertoire of bearded seals seemed to be relatively stable; for example, over a period of 16 years no calls were lost or added to the Alaskan repertoire. The most likely explanation for the observed vocal differences between sites is the geographical isolation of populations by physical distance. Other factors, such as varying ecological influences (e.g. adaptation to varying ice habitats) or sexual selection, may also contribute to vocal variability and result in the observed geographical variation.},

abstract = {In the subantarctic fur seal Arctocephalus tropicalis, mothers leave their pups during the rearing period to make long and frequent feeding trips to sea. When a female returns from the ocean, she has to find her pup among several hundred others. Taking into account both spectral and temporal domains, we investigated the individual vocal signature occurring in the 'female attraction call' used by pups to attract their mother. We calculated the intra- and inter-individual variability for each measured acoustic cue to isolate those likely to contain information about individual identity. We then tested these cues in playback experiments. Our results show that a female pays particular attention to the lower part of the signal spectrum, the fundamental frequency accompanied by its first two harmonics being sufficient to elicit reliable recognition. The spectral energy distribution is also important for the recognition process. Of the temporal features, frequency modulation appears to be a key component for individual recognition, whereas amplitude modulation is not implicated in the identification of the pup's voice by its mother. We discuss these results with respect to the constraints imposed on fur seals by a colonial way of life.},

The alarm produced 0.3 s tonal signals randomly selected from a set of 16 with fundamental frequencies between 9 and 15 kHz, with a constant pulse interval of 4.0 s (duty cycle 8{\%}) and a Source Level range of 133-163 dB re 1 [mu]Pa (rms). The effect of the alarm was judged by comparing the animals' respiration rate and position relative to the alarm during test periods with those during baseline periods. As in a previous study on two porpoises with the same alarm, the porpoise in the present study reacted strongly to the alarm by swimming away from it and increasing his respiration rate. The striped dolphin, however, showed no reaction to the active alarm. Based on harbour porpoise audiograms and the specific audiogram of the striped dolphin in the present study, and the low background noise levels during the experiment, both animals must have heard the alarm signals clearly. This study indicates that cetacean species are not equally sensitive to human-made noise disturbance. Therefore, source levels of acoustic alarms should be adapted to the species they are supposed to deter. In addition, alarms should be tested on each odontocete species for which they are intended to reduce bycatch.},

abstract = {Global positioning system (GPS) telemetry technology allows us to monitor and to map the details of animal movement, securing vast quantities of such data even for highly cryptic organisms. We envision an exciting synergy between animal ecology and GPS-based radiotelemetry, as for other examples of new technologies stimulating rapid conceptual advances, where research opportunities have been paralleled by technical and analytical challenges. Animal positions provide the elemental unit of movement paths and show where individuals interact with the ecosystems around them. We discuss how knowing where animals go can help scientists in their search for a mechanistic understanding of key concepts of animal ecology, including resource use, home range and dispersal, and population dynamics. It is probable that in the not-so-distant future, intense sampling of movements coupled with detailed information on habitat features at a variety of scales will allow us to represent an animal's cognitive map of its environment, and the intimate relationship between behaviour and fitness. An extended use of these data over long periods of time and over large spatial scales can provide robust inferences for complex, multi-factorial phenomena, such as meta-analyses of the effects of climate change on animal behaviour and distribution.},

abstract = {Arboreal animals negotiate a highly three-dimensional world that is discontinuous on many spatial scales. As the scale of substrate discontinuity increases, many arboreal animals rely on leaping or gliding locomotion between distant supports. In order to successfully move through their habitat, gliding animals must actively modulate both propulsive and aerodynamic forces. Here we examined the take-off and landing kinetics of a free-ranging gliding mammal, the Malayan colugo (Galeopterus variegatus) using a custom-designed three-dimensional accelerometry system. We found that colugos increase the propulsive impulse to affect longer glides. However, we also found that landing forces are negatively associated with glide distance. Landing forces decrease rapidly as glide distance increases from the shortest glides, then level off, suggesting that the ability to reorient the aerodynamic forces prior to landing is an important mechanism to reduce velocity and thus landing forces. This ability to substantially alter the aerodynamic forces acting on the patagial wing in order to reorient the body is a key to the transition between leaping and gliding and allows gliding mammals to travel long distances between trees with reduced risk of injury. Longer glides may increase the access to distributed resources and reduce the exposure to predators in the canopy or on the forest floor.},

We conclude that while our understanding of fish hearing has increased substantially in the past years, there are still major gaps in what we know. In particular, the comparative functional literature is extremely limited, and we do not yet know whether different species, and particularly hearing specialists as compared to hearing nonspecialists, have fundamentally different auditory capabilities and mechanisms.},

abstract = {A male song sparrow,Melospiza melodia, has a song repertoire of about eight or nine distinct song types, and he typically shares several of these song types with each of his several neighbours. In the prevailing theoretical view, the song types in a bird's repertoire are interchangeable and multiple song types exist primarily to provide diversity. The present study was designed to test a contrary hypothesis concerning one particular context, counter-singing between neighbours. Specifically, the hypothesis was tested that song sparrows reply to the songs of particular neighbours with particular songs from their repertoire: they select a song type they share with that neighbour ([`]repertoire matching'). In a field experiment, neighbour song was played to the subject from just inside the neighbour's territory. Subjects responded with a song shared with that neighbour in 87.5{\%} of trials (chance expectation for this sample is 42{\%}). In control trials, where stranger song was presented from the same location, subjects responded with songs shared with the neighbour at that location in only 17{\%} of the trials. It is suggested that [`]repertoire matching' may be one advantage of a song learning strategy that produces song sharing between neighbours.},

Lethaia, 10.1111/j.1502-3931.2007.00032.x Echolocation has evolved independently in several vertebrate groups, and hypotheses about the origin of echolocation in these groups often invoke abiotic mechanisms driving morphological evolution. In bats, for example, the ecological setting associated with the origin of echolocation has been linked to global warming during the Palaeocene2013Eocene; similarly, the origin of toothed whales (odontocetes) has been broadly correlated with the establishment of the circum-Antarctic current. These scenarios, and the adaptational hypotheses for the evolution of echolocation with which they are associated, neglect a consideration of possible biotic mechanisms. Here we propose that the origin of echolocation in odontocetes was initially an adaptation for nocturnal epipelagic feeding 2013 primarily on diel migrating cephalopods. We test this hypothesis using data on the temporal, geographical, and water column distributions of odontocetes and cephalopods, and other global events from their respective tertiary histories. From this analysis, we suggest that echolocation in early odontocetes aided nocturnal feeding on cephalopods and other prey items, and that this early system was exapted for deep diving and hunting at depths below the photic zone where abundant cephalopod resources were available 24 h a day. This scenario extends to the evolution of other cephalopod feeding (teuthophagous) marine vertebrates such as pinnipeds and Mesozoic marine reptiles.},

abstract = {The vocal repertoire of Philautus leucorhinus, a Rhacophorid frog, consists of several distinct call-types, each used in a different social context. Males defend space in choruses by calling, and ultimately by fighting off rival males. Vocal interactions between males begin with exchanges of territorial calls followed by multi-note calls. Males frequently [`]match' their rival's preceding call by responding with a multi-note call containing a similar number of notes. Vocal interactions become more escalated as the distance between males decreases but the accuracy of matching is apparently unaffected by distance. Males respond to playbacks of advertisement calls or territorial calls by increasing the frequency of territorial calls and the number of notes in their calls. It is suggested that the level of escalation in vocal interactions is a graded threat, signalling the probability of attack. Two explanations of vocal matching are offered: matching may be an effective means of directing threat signals at a particular rival and/or it may be a consequence of vocal competition for females.},

The basic song evolves through a series of different sounds in a fixed order. The song is produced only in the winter tropical calving grounds, just before the whales arrive on the banks. Redundancy is high in that syllables, motifs, phrases and the entire song are repeated. Low, intermediate, and high-frequency sounds are scattered throughout the song. One sound is associated with blowing. The song appears to be partially different each year and there are some differences within a year between banks which may indicate that dialects are present. It is suggested that songs from other populations are quite different. The apparent yearly changes do not occur at one point in time. Only single individuals produce the song and they are hypothesized to be young, sexually mature males. The implications of these various design features are discussed.},

Direct observations of roe deer revealed that animals orient their heads northward when grazing or resting. Amazingly, this ubiquitous phenomenon does not seem to have been noticed by herdsmen, ranchers, or hunters. Because wind and light conditions could be excluded as a common denominator determining the body axis orientation, magnetic alignment is the most parsimonious explanation. To test the hypothesis that cattle orient their body axes along the field lines of the Earth's magnetic field, we analyzed the body orientation of cattle from localities with high magnetic declination. Here, magnetic north was a better predictor than geographic north. This study reveals the magnetic alignment in large mammals based on statistically sufficient sample sizes. Our findings open horizons for the study of magnetoreception in general and are of potential significance for applied ethology (husbandry, animal welfare). They challenge neuroscientists and biophysics to explain the proximate mechanisms.},

We tested the effects that ocean acidification from elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO) could have on the ability of larvae to detect olfactory cues from adult habitats. Larval clownfish reared in control seawater (pH 8.15) discriminated between a range of cues that could help them locate reef habitat and suitable settlement sites. This discriminatory ability was disrupted when larvae were reared in conditions simulating CO-induced ocean acidification. Larvae became strongly attracted to olfactory stimuli they normally avoided when reared at levels of ocean pH that could occur 2100 (pH 7.8) and they no longer responded to any olfactory cues when reared at pH levels (pH 7.6) that might be attained later next century on a business-as-usual carbon-dioxide emissions trajectory. If acidification continues unabated, the impairment of sensory ability will reduce population sustainability of many marine species, with potentially profound consequences for marine diversity.},

abstract = {The principal aim of this study was to describe the vocalisations produced by the largely unstudied white-whale population in Svalbard, Norway. It was found that Svalbard's white whales produced most of the vocalisations that have been documented in other populations, but they also displayed minor vocal novelties and differences. A subjective classification suggested 21 call types, which were dominated by a variety of whistles. A statistical classification (cluster analyses) produced 11 groupings (after exclusion of general pulsed call types), which contained fairly logical grouping of the subjectively determined call types. However, neither method of classification employed was considered ideal for classifying white-whale vocalisations because of the highly graded nature of the calls. The white whales in this study were most vocal during milling and joining behaviours. A surprising result in this study was how little time white whales in this area spent vocalising. Their relative silence could possibly be: (1) an anti-predator strategy in response to killer whales (Orcinus orca); (2) a result of the type of schools encountered during this study (all-male grouping); (3) a by-product of the presence of the research boat in an area where whales are not accustomed to boat traffic; or (4) a result of the limited behavioural repertoire covered in this study. More extensive studies of acoustic behaviour of this population, which include various age and sex classes, with broader seasonal coverage that includes more potential behavioural contexts, are required before firm conclusions can be made regarding geographic trends in white-whale acoustic behaviour.},

The QERB dependence on probe frequency could be approximated by regression lines with a slope of 0.83 to 0.86 in log-log scale, which corresponded to almost frequency-proportional quality and almost constant bandwidth of 3-4 kHz.

Of the primary whistles produced by one dolphin, 78{\%} were of type 1 (22{\%} type 2), while 69{\%} of primary whistles from the other dolphin were of type 2 (31{\%} type 1). The result that each of the dolphins favored a different primary whistle supports the findings of Caldwell and Caldwell (1965), that each dolphin produces an individually distinctive whistle. But in the present study, both dolphins produced both primary whistle types. This may represent mimicry of signature whistles.},

abstract = {Comparisons of the Irrawaddy dolphin, Orcaella brevirostris, between Australian and Asian sites documented geographic differences in height of dorsal fin, presence or absence of a median dorsal groove in front of the dorsal fin, and coloration (presence or absence of a dorsal cape). Analysis of genetic data provided support for two clades within the Asian samples, the Mekong River samples from Cambodia and southern Laos, and all other marine and freshwater sites from Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The major separation, however, was between sites in Asia and those from Australia (5.9{\%} of base pair differences, compared with 1.2{\%} for within Australia and 1.5{\%} for within Asia). Within a 403 base segment of the mtDNA control region, Australian specimens had 17 diagnostic sites with 16 fixed base pair differences and one insertion/deletion. Consistent, statistically significant differences in skull characters of Australian specimens have previously been demonstrated and are reviewed in this paper. There was a high concordance in character differences demonstrated between O. brevirostris from all Asian sites and Australian specimens, especially in the genetic and osteological characters. Based on the range and concordance of character differences, we propose that the Australian dolphins be recognized as a new species, Orcaella heinsohni (suggested common name: Australian snubfin dolphin).},

Feeding buzzes consist of short echolocation pulses produced at a rapid rate just before contact between a flying bat and its prey. The hypothesis that the duration of the feeding buzz reflects the size of the attacked prey was not supported by the data. The mean lengths of silent periods between the end of the feeding buzz and the next echolocation call were significantly longer after successful attacks than after unsuccessful attacks. There was, however, no threshold value unambiguously separating successful from unsuccessful attacks in either species. The responses of bats to tossed pebbles and to some insects indicated that during some feeding buzzes L. borealis and L. cinereus judged the nature and range of prey being attacked. Attacks by free-flying L. borealis on muted arctiid moths (Hypoprepia fucosa), combined with the rejection of these moths as food by captive bats, suggest that in this setting the clicks of these moths are aposematic signals, warning the bats of the moths' bad taste.},

abstract = {Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) continue to grow in popularity due to their ability to directly acknowledge multiple levels of dependency and model different data types. For small sample sizes especially, likelihood-based inference can be unreliable with variance components being particularly difficult to estimate. A Bayesian approach is appealing but has been hampered by the lack of a fast implementation, and the difficulty in specifying prior distributions with variance components again being particularly problematic. Here, we briefly review previous approaches to computation in Bayesian implementations of GLMMs and illustrate in detail, the use of integrated nested Laplace approximations in this context. We consider a number of examples, carefully specifying prior distributions on meaningful quantities in each case. The examples cover a wide range of data types including those requiring smoothing over time and a relatively complicated spline model for which we examine our prior specification in terms of the implied degrees of freedom. We conclude that Bayesian inference is now practically feasible for GLMMs and provides an attractive alternative to likelihood-based approaches such as penalized quasi-likelihood. As with likelihood-based approaches, great care is required in the analysis of clustered binary data since approximation strategies may be less accurate for such data.},

During control periods when the AHD was inactive, the mean number of porpoises observed in the study area was 0.39 for broad area scans conducted with the naked eye and 0.48 for narrow sector scans conducted with binoculars. Abundance declined precipitously when the AHD was activated, to 0.007 porpoises per broad area scan and 0.018 per narrow sector scan. The mean number of porpoise resightings while tracking their movements also declined from 12.2 to 13.6 per sighting during control periods to 1.1-1.9 per sighting when the AHD was activated, which suggested that the few porpoises that ventured into the study area spent less time within it when the AHD was activated. The effect of the AHD diminished with distance. No porpoises were observed within 200 m of the AHD when it was activated. The number of sightings and resightings observed when it was activated was less than 0.2{\%} of the number expected had there been no AHD effect at a range of 200-399 m, 1.4{\%} the number expected at a range of 400-599 m, varied between 2.5{\%} and 3.3{\%} of the number expected at a range of 600-2,499 m, and was 8.1{\%} the number expected at a range of 2,500-3,500 m, which suggested that the impact of the AHD extended beyond our maximum sighting range of 3.5 km.},

abstract = {This paper describes the high-frequency echolocation signals from free-ranging Yangtze finless porpoise in the Tian-e-zhou Baiji National Natural Reserve in Hubei Province, China. Signal analysis showed that the Yangtze finless porpoise clicks are typical high-frequency narrow-band (relative width of the frequency spectrum Q=6.6 {\&}PLUSMN; 1.56, N=548) ultrasonic pulses. The peak frequencies of the typical clicks range from 87 to 145 kHz with an average of 125 {\&}PLUSMN; 6.92 kHz. The durations range from 30 to 122 {\&}mu; s with an average of 68 {\&}PLUSMN; 14.12 {\&}mu; s. The characteristics of the signals are similar to those of other members of the Phocoenidae as well as the distantly related delphinids, Cephalorhynchus spp. Comparison of these signals to those of the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer), who occupies habitat similar to that of the Yangtze finless porpoise, showed that the peak frequencies of clicks produced by the Yangtze finless porpoise are remarkably higher than those produced by the baiji. Difference in peak frequency between the two species is probably linked to the different size of prefer-red prey fish. Clear double-pulse and multi-pulse reverberation structures of clicks are noticed, and there is no indication of any low-frequency ({\&}LT; 70 kHz) components during the recording period. {\&}COPY; 2005 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {Echolocating bats transmit ultrasonic vocalizations and use information contained in the reflected sounds to analyze the auditory scene. Auditory scene analysis, a phenomenon that applies broadly to all hearing vertebrates, involves the grouping and segregation of sounds to perceptually organize information about auditory objects. The perceptual organization of sound is influenced by the spectral and temporal characteristics of acoustic signals. In the case of the echolocating bat, its active control over the timing, duration, intensity, and bandwidth of sonar transmissions directly impacts its perception of the auditory objects that comprise the scene. Here, data are presented from perceptual experiments, laboratory insect capture studies, and field recordings of sonar behavior of different bat species, to illustrate principles of importance to auditory scene analysis by echolocation in bats. In the perceptual experiments, FM bats (Eptesicus fuscus) learned to discriminate between systematic and random delay sequences in echo playback sets. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the FM bat can assemble information about echo delay changes over time, a requirement for the analysis of a dynamic auditory scene. Laboratory insect capture experiments examined the vocal production patterns of flying E. fuscus taking tethered insects in a large room. In each trial, the bats consistently produced echolocation signal groups with a relatively stable repetition rate (within 5{\%}). Similar temporal patterning of sonar vocalizations was also observed in the field recordings from E. fuscus, thus suggesting the importance of temporal control of vocal production for perceptually guided behavior. It is hypothesized that a stable sonar signal production rate facilitates the perceptual organization of echoes arriving from objects at different directions and distances as the bat flies through a dynamic auditory scene. Field recordings of E. fuscus, Noctilio albiventris, N. leporinus, Pippistrellus pippistrellus, and Cormura brevirostris revealed that spectral adjustments in sonar signals may also be important to permit tracking of echoes in a complex auditory scene.

Midshipman fish, like other teleosts, use the saccule as the main acoustic end organ of the inner ear. In this study, we examined the discharge properties and the frequency response dynamics of auditory saccular afferent neurons in pre-adult midshipman ([{\~{}}]4-12 months of age) to determine whether encoding of auditory information, inclusive of conspecific vocalizations, changes across life history stages. Extracellular single unit recordings were made from saccular afferents while sound was presented via an underwater speaker. Comparisons with adult data show that the resting discharge rate and auditory threshold sensitivity increased with age/size, while temporal encoding of frequency did not show any significant shifts. The results indicate that the saccular afferents of juveniles, like those of non-reproductive adults, are best adapted to temporally encode the low frequency components ([{\&}le;]100 Hz) of midshipman vocalizations. This report represents the first in vivo investigation of age-related changes in the encoding properties of individual auditory neurons for any fish species.},

abstract = {Many salmon aquaculture sites in the Bay of Fundy employ acoustic harassment devices (AHDs) to deter seats from approaching fish pens. These devices may also exclude harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) from important habitat. To determine the effects of AHDs on harbour porpoises an AHD was deployed experimentally in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Relative porpoise abundance (visual scans) and porpoise movements (tracked by theodolite) were recorded for separate, daily, 2-h periods in the vicinity of either an active (n = 9) or inactive (n = 7) AHD. Fewer porpoises were sighted during active periods (0.22 +/- 0.44, mean +/- SD) than inactive periods (2.91 +/- 1.29; P {\textless} 0.05). The mean closest observed approach of porpoises to the AHD during active periods (991 +/- 302 m) was significantly greater than during inactive periods (364 +/- 261 m; P{\textless}0.01). Porpoise density was therefore reduced in the vicinity of active an AHD. These results should be considered before AHDs are deployed in porpoise habitat. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Toothed whales (Cetacea, odontoceti) use biosonar to navigate their environment and to find and catch prey. All studied toothed whale species have evolved highly directional, high-amplitude ultrasonic clicks suited for long-range echolocation of prey in open water. Little is known about the biosonar signals of toothed whale species inhabiting freshwater habitats such as endangered river dolphins. To address the evolutionary pressures shaping the echolocation signal parameters of non-marine toothed whales, we investigated the biosonar source parameters of Ganges river dolphins (Platanista gangetica gangetica) and Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) within the river systems of the Sundarban mangrove forest. Both Ganges and Irrawaddy dolphins produced echolocation clicks with a high repetition rate and low source level compared to marine species. Irrawaddy dolphins, inhabiting coastal and riverine habitats, produced a mean source level of 195 dB (max 203 dB) re 1 µPapp whereas Ganges river dolphins, living exclusively upriver, produced a mean source level of 184 dB (max 191) re 1 µPapp. These source levels are 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than those of similar sized marine delphinids and may reflect an adaptation to a shallow, acoustically complex freshwater habitat with high reverberation and acoustic clutter. The centroid frequency of Ganges river dolphin clicks are an octave lower than predicted from scaling, but with an estimated beamwidth comparable to that of porpoises. The unique bony maxillary crests found in the Platanista forehead may help achieve a higher directionality than expected using clicks nearly an octave lower than similar sized odontocetes.},

abstract = {We consider a multidimensional, continuous-time model where the observation process is a diffusion with drift and volatility coefficients being modeled as continuous-time, finite-state Markov chains with a common state process. For the econometric estimation of the states for drift and volatility and the rate matrix of the underlying Markov chain, we develop both an exact continuous time and an approximate discrete-time Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler and compare these approaches with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. For simulated data, MCMC outperforms ML estimation for difficult cases like high rates. Finally, for daily stock index quotes from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and the USA we identify four states differing not only in the volatility of the various assets but also in their correlation.},

abstract = {We used vocalizations to examine the behaviour of male bearded seals, Erignathus barbatus, in relation to ice cover over 2 consecutive years. Site fidelity varied between males. Territorial males returned to the same display locations in successive years, whereas roaming males returned to the study area but not to specific display locations. Males did not vocalize under the land-fast-ice edge and were therefore limited by access to areas of drift ice and open water for the purpose of displaying. Between-year fluctuations in ice cover restricted the number of displaying males during the early part of the mating season in April. Decreased ice cover during May resulted in more males displaying, but the number of males declined in June irrespective of the continued decline in ice cover. Roaming males were not heard when the ice cover was more than 60{\%}, whereas territorial males were present during all ice conditions. Yearly fluctuations in ice cover may alter the long-term mating success of individuals and predictably available display areas may be preferred to areas that are more likely to be enclosed by fast-ice in some years.},

abstract = {Two groups of underwater vocalizations were identified in a three-year study of two captive leopard seals, Hydrurga leptonyx (one female and one male at Taronga Zoo, Sydney). This was supplemented by recordings over three months from a male at Marineland, New Zealand. The sexual state of the seals at Taronga was deduced from serum hormonal concentrations: the female was considered to be in estrus at specific times during the breeding season. The seal at Marineland, New Zealand was assumed to be sexually mature on the basis of size and age. Of 12 different underwater sound types recorded, six were produced by the seals at Taronga Zoo during agonistic interactions (local calls) and were heard through most of the year. The other six sound types were produced by lone seals. These broadcast calls were produced by the female only when sexually receptive, and by the mature male during December and January, months believed to be the breeding season of wild leopard seals. We propose that underwater acoustic behavior is important in the mating system of this species, and that broadcast calls are used by mature females to advertise their sexual receptivity, and possibly by mature males in search of mates.},

abstract = {American water shrews () are aggressive predators that feed on a variety of terrestrial and aquatic prey. They often forage at night, diving into streams and ponds in search of food. We investigated how shrews locate submerged prey using high-speed videography, infrared lighting, and stimuli designed to mimic prey. Shrews attacked brief water movements, indicating motion is an important cue used to detect active or escaping prey. They also bit, retrieved, and attempted to eat model fish made of silicone in preference to other silicone objects showing that tactile cues are important in the absence of movement. In addition, water shrews preferentially sniffed model prey fish and crickets underwater by exhaling and reinhaling air through the nostrils, suggesting olfaction plays an important role in aquatic foraging. The possibility of echolocation, sonar, or electroreception was investigated by testing for ultrasonic and audible calls above and below water and by presenting electric fields to foraging shrews. We found no evidence for these abilities. We conclude that water shrews detect motion, shape, and smell to find prey underwater. The short latency of attacks to water movements suggests shrews may use a flush-pursuit strategy to capture some prey.},

Sound production behavior provides an opportunity to Study various aspects of fish biology, such as spawning behavior and habitat selection, in a noninvasive manner. Passive acoustics is an active area of ichthyological research. However, fish bioacousticians have generally not published their research in the fisheries literature. Therefore, fisheries scientists may not be fully aware of progress being made in this field or of potential uses for passive acoustic techniques. In this paper, I discuss the evolutionary, physiological, and behavioral aspects of sound production by fishes; investigate the publication patterns of research on fish sound production; review the literature on the application of passive acoustic methods to fisheries research; and suggest ways of designing passive acoustic surveys to optimize the quantity and quality of information obtained. Passive acoustic methods can be an attractive alternative or supplement to traditional fisheries assessment techniques because they are noninvasive, can be conducted at low cost, and can cover a large study area at high spatial and temporal resolution. However, as in all fisheries surveys, research questions should be defined clearly at the outset and careful planning is necessary to obtain the data required to address those questions.},

We manipulated dispersal patterns of Manilkara mabokeensis, a monkey-dispersed tree, to assess the extent to which spatial distributions of seeds drive seedling recruitment. Based on the natural seed shadow, we created seed distributions with seeds deposited under the canopy (“no dispersal”), with declining density from the tree (“natural dispersal”), and at uniform densities (“good dispersal”). These distributions mimicked dispersal patterns that could occur with the extirpation of monkeys, low levels of hunting, and high rates of seed dispersal. We monitored seedling emergence and survival for 18 months and recorded the number of leaves and damage to leaves. “Good dispersal” increased seedling survival by 26{\%}, and “no dispersal” decreased survival by 78{\%}, relative to “natural dispersal.” Using a mixed-effects survival model, we decoupled t...},

abstract = {Individual preferences for good habitat are often thought to have a beneficial stabilizing effect for populations. However, if individuals preferentially compete for better-quality territories, these may become hotspots of conflict. We show that, in an endangered species, this process decreases the productivity of favoured territories to the extent that differences in productivity between territories disappear. Unlike predictions from current demographic theory on site-dependent population regulation (ideal despotic distribution), we show that population productivity is reduced if resources are distributed unevenly in space. Competition for high-quality habitat can thus have detrimental consequences for populations even though it benefits individuals. Manipulating conflict (e.g. by reducing variation in habitat quality) can therefore prove an effective conservation measure in species with strong social or territorial conflict.},

In total 1359 click trains were recorded during 4.6 h for the harbor porpoise and 46,240 click trains were recorded during 82.3 h for the finless porpoises. The harbor and finless porpoises produced sonar click trains every 12.3 and 6.4 s on average, respectively. During the inter-click-train interval, the porpoises were silent or produced clicks below 148 dB re. 1 mu Pa, the detection threshold of the tag. Ninety percent of the inter-click-train intervals were 20 s or less in both species. This means that porpoises frequently produce intense click trains. Click-train intervals lasting over 50 s constituted 1{\%} of the total intervals in finless porpoises and 4{\%} in the harbor porpoise. Both species swam without intense clicks for less than 10 in in most cases, but occasionally remained silent or used undetected low-intensity clicks for more than 1 min. During these periods, the porpoises would be susceptible to entanglement in fishing nets. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We present a unified approach to regression analysis of such irregularly timed multivariate longitudinal data, with particular attention to assessment of the magnitude and durability of cross-component correlation. Maximum likelihood estimates are presented for component-specific regression parameters and autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions. The component-specific autocorrelation function has the 'damped exponential' form [see text], which generalizes the AR(1), MA(1) and random intercept models for univariate longitudinal outcomes. The cross-component correlation function (CCCF) has an analogous form, allowing damped-exponential decay of cross-component correlation as time between repeated measures elapses. Finite sample performance is assessed through simulation studies. The methods are illustrated through blood pressure modelling and construction of multivariate prediction regions.},

abstract = {Culture has long been assumed to be uniquely human but recent studies, in particular on great apes, have suggested that cultures also occur in non-human primates. The most apparent cultural behaviours in great apes involve tools in the subsistence context where they are clearly functional to obtain valued food. On the other hand, tool-use to modify acoustic communication has been reported only once and its function has not been investigated. Thus, the question whether this is an adaptive behaviour remains open, even though evidence indicates that it is socially transmitted (i.e. cultural). Here we report on wild orang-utans using tools to modulate the maximum frequency of one of their sounds, the kiss squeak, emitted in distress. In this variant, orang-utans strip leaves off a twig and hold them to their mouth while producing a kiss squeak. Using leaves as a tool lowers the frequency of the call compared to a kiss squeak without leaves or with only a hand to the mouth. If the lowering of the maximum frequency functions in orang-utans as it does in other animals, two predictions follow: (i) kiss squeak frequency is related to body size and (ii) the use of leaves will occur in situations of most acute danger. Supporting these predictions, kiss squeaks without tools decreased with body size and kiss squeaks with leaves were only emitted by highly distressed individuals. Moreover, we found indications that the calls were under volitional control. This finding is significant for at least two reasons. First, although few animal species are known to deceptively lower the maximum frequency of their calls to exaggerate their perceived size to the listener (e.g. vocal tract elongation in male deer) it has never been reported that animals may use tools to achieve this, or that they are primates. Second, it shows that the orang-utan culture extends into the communicative domain, thus challenging the traditional assumption that primate calling behaviour is overall purely emotional.},

abstract = {Underwater noise pollution is an increasing environmental problem which might affect communication, behaviour, fitness and consequently species' survival. The most common anthropogenic noises in aquatic habitats derive from shipping. In the present study we investigated the implications of noise pollution from a ship on the sound detectability, namely of conspecific vocalizations in the Lusitanian toadfish, Halobatrachus didactylus. Ambient and ferry-boat noises were recorded in the Tagus River estuary (Portugal), as well as toadfish sounds, and their sound pressure levels determined. Hearing sensitivities were measured under quiet lab conditions and in the presence of these masking noises at levels encountered in the field, using the auditory evoked potentials (AEP) recording technique. The Lusitanian toadfish is a hearing generalist, with best hearing sensitivity at low frequencies between 50 and 200 Hz (below 100 dB re. 1 {\{}micro{\}}Pa). Under ambient noise conditions, hearing was only slightly masked at lower frequencies. In the presence of ship noise, auditory thresholds increased considerably, by up to 36 dB, at most frequencies tested. This is mainly because the main energies of ferry-boat noise were within the most sensitive hearing range of this species. Comparisons between masked audiograms and sound spectra of the toadfish's mating and agonistic vocalizations revealed that ship noise decreased the ability to detect conspecific acoustic signals. This study provides the first evidence that fishes' auditory sensitivity can be impaired by ship noise and that acoustic communication, which is essential during agonistic encounters and mate attraction, might be restricted in coastal environments altered by human activity.},

abstract = {In the aquatically mating harbour seal, Phoca vitulina, oestrous females show marked differences in spatial and temporal distribution between geographical areas. This suggests that the males' display behaviour may also vary between areas. We recorded male vocalizations in two areas, the Moray Firth and Orkney, U.K. In the Moray Firth, females haul out on a few intertidal sandbars and travel along predictable routes to forage at sea. In Orkney, female haul out sites are much less influenced by tidal availability and females are much more dispersed. In the Moray Firth, males vocalized only during a short mating season, from 1 July to 12 August. Vocalizations varied significantly with the tide, the peak at high tide clearly coinciding with the period when most females were in the water. In contrast, vocalizations in Orkney were significantly related to both tidal and diel patterns. We suggest that the timing of male vocalizations reflects differences in female availability between sites. In the inner Moray Firth, vocalizations were heard throughout the females' range, whereas vocalizations in Orkney were heard only in two discrete areas. However, at both sites the density of vocalizing males was highest in narrow channels and/or along predictable female travel routes. Therefore, males clearly adapt their temporal and spatial behaviour patterns to variations in female distribution and density. These results suggest that male mating strategies in aquatically mating pinnipeds are more variable than was previously envisaged. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

We compared nine whistle characteristics between continental shelf and offshore Atlantic spotted dolphins in the western North Atlantic and between northern Gulf of Mexico and western North Atlantic bottlenose dolphins and pilot whales using discriminant analysis. Offshore Atlantic spotted dolphin whistles were significantly different (Hotelling's T-2, P = 0.0003) from continental shelf whistles in high frequency, bandwidth, duration, number of steps, and number of inflection points. Atlantic bottlenose dolphin whistles were significantly different (Hotelling's T-2, P {\textless} 0.0001) from those in the Gulf of Mexico in duration, number of steps, and number of inflection points. There was no significant difference between pilot whale whistles in the two basins. The whistle differences indicate acoustic divergence between groups in different areas that may arise from geographic isolation or habitat separation between neighboring but genetically distinct populations of dolphins. This study supports the premise that acoustic differences can be a tool to evaluate the ecological separation between marine mammal groups in field studies.},

abstract = {I investigated group size variability in dolphins and porpoises using intraspecific comparisons. Explanatory factors considered in the analysis were variables of the physical environment, the diet, and the life history of the species. Open habitat and small body size were viewed as increasing predation risk. This pattern was apparent in Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) and weakly apparent in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.). Group size was negatively correlated with body size in pilot whales (Globicephala spp.) and positively correlated with the openness of habitat in killer whales (Orcinus orca), striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), and common dolphins (Delphinus spp.). No such relationship was found for harbor and Dall's porpoises (Phocoena phocoena, P. dalli). Group size also seemed to vary depending on other physical measures of the habitat, which may indirectly reflect diet; group size showed U-shaped patterns if related to temperature. The predictive power of variables comprising detailed prey information on group size was variable. For example, pilot whales had smaller group sizes when they fed more on mesopelagic fish and less on mesopelagic cephalopods, and common dolphins had larger groups if they fed on varying types of fish. In most Delphinoidea species, group size could be described by the variables considered in this study. But each species showed its own pattern of correlations between group size and a specific set of explanatory variables. Thus, no general and consistent relation between group size and the other variables was found. It remains unknown whether these species-specific patterns result from a historical process or whether they are specialized adaptations.},

abstract = {Male vocal displays play an important role in sexual selection through both male-male competition and female choice. While this is supported by numerous studies in birds, much less attention has been paid to the role of such displays in mammals. We investigated the function of vocal displays in a polygynous mammal, the Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki). In our study population a large proportion of mature males are unable to establish a territory, providing the opportunity to compare the vocal behaviour between territorial and non-territorial males. We examined how seasonal patterns of vocalizations differed between territorial and non-territorial males and how the number of females present in a territory influenced behaviour of territorial males. We found that territorial males vocalized at higher rates than non-territorial males, and territorial males vocalized more at the onset than towards the end of territory tenure. During the onset of territory-tenure vocalizations of territorial males were directed more often towards other males than females. Furthermore, we found that vocalizations of territorial males were not only given in male-male interactions, but were also actively directed towards females. Territorial males vocalized at higher rates when more females were present in their territory. Our results suggest that vocalizations are important in male-male interactions, are relevant in territorial disputes and are used as a proxy for females to assess a male's quality.},

abstract = {A controlled experiment was carried out in 1996-1997 to determine whether acoustic deterrent devices (pingers) reduce marine mammal bycatch in the California drift gill net fishery for swordfish and sharks. Using Fisher's exact test, bycatch rates with pingers were significantly less for all cetacean species combined (P {\textless} 0.001) and for all pinniped species combined (P = 0.003). For species tested separately with this test, bycatch reduction was statistically significant for short-beaked common dolphins (P = 0.001) and California sea lions (P = 0.02). Bycatch reduction is not statistically significant for the other species tested separately, but sample sizes and statistical power were low, and bycatch rates were lower in pingered nets for six of the eight other cetacean and pinniped species. A log-linear model relating the mean rate of entanglement to the number of pingers deployed was fit to the data for three groups: short-beaked common dolphins, other cetaceans, and pinnipeds. For a net with 40 pingers, the models predict approximately a 12-fold decrease in entanglement for short-beaked common dolphins, a 4-fold decrease for other cetaceans, and a 3-fold decrease for pinnipeds. No other variables were found that could explain this effect. The pinger experiment ended when regulations were enacted to make pingers mandatory in this fishery.},

abstract = {To reduce the risks involved in investigating potential food, individuals may use social information from more experienced conspecifics. Infants of generalist foragers are those most often confronted with unknown food items. To investigate the extent to which the response of infant common marmosets, Callitrix jacchus towards novel food is influenced by the presence of experienced adults, we confronted six infants with novel and familiar food, either in their family group or in the absence of adults. In the absence of adults, the infants either refused to eat the unknown items or ate only small amounts, waiting longer and investigating the food more before feeding than when food was familiar. When adults were present during food presentation, differences in the treatment of familiar and novel food were much less pronounced, suggesting that social facilitation helped to overcome neophobia in the infants. Short approach latencies and high exploration rates indicate that the infants simultaneously showed high levels of both neophobia and neophilia, as predicted for individuals living in complex and variable environments that hold substantial foraging risks. Food transfers from adults to infants made up 17.5{\%} of the food ingested by the infants and were usually initiated by the infants. Infants were more likely to take the first piece of food from an adult when it was novel than when it was familiar. The mean number of food transfer attempts and the proportion of ingested food that was acquired socially were higher for novel than for familiar food. Such effects of novelty suggest that food transfers function to transmit information. (c) 2006 The Associatioo for the Study of Animal Behaviour, Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The characteristics of the whistles of Hawaiian spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) are considered by examining concurrently the whistle repertoire (whistle types) and the frequency of occurrence of each whistle type (whistle usage). Whistles were recorded off six islands in the Hawaiian Archipelago. In this study Hawaiian spinner dolphins emitted frequency modulated whistles that often sweep up in frequency (47{\%} of the whistles were upsweeps). The frequency span of the fundamental component was mainly between 2 and 22 kHz (about 94{\%} of the whistles) with an average mid-frequency of 12.9 kHz. The duration of spinner whistles was relatively short, mainly within a span of 0.05 to 1.28 s (about 94{\%} of the whistles) with an average value of 0.49 s. The average maximum frequency of 15.9 kHz obtained by this study is consistent with the body length versus maximum frequency relationship obtained by Wang et al. (1995a) when using spinner dolphin adult body length measurements. When comparing the average values of whistle parameters obtained by this and other studies in the Island of Hawaii, statistically significant differences were found between studies. The reasons for these differences are not obvious. Some possibilities include differences in the upper frequency limit of the recording systems, different spinner groups being recorded, and observer differences in viewing spectrograms. Standardization in recording and analysis procedure is clearly needed. (C) 2002 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {Of the numerous hypotheses advanced to explain the adaptive significance of play, several assert that social play increases social harmony, cementing alliances and reducing aggression between group members or littermates. These hypotheses are frequently cited, but their validity remains unknown. We examined the relation between social play and aggression in juvenile meerkats, Suricata suricatta, living in a wild population in the southern Kalahari Desert. We tested the hypothesis that social play reduces aggression, by examining rates of play, play partner choices, the structure of social play and rates of aggressive interactions during foraging. We found no relation between frequency of play and level of aggression, either between individuals or during the course of development. Pups that played together frequently were just as aggressive towards one another as pairs of pups that played infrequently, and play interactions had no subsequent effect on the likelihood of aggression. In contrast, aggressive interactions during foraging inhibited the subsequent likelihood of play, and high levels of aggression during foraging changed the structure of social play, with victimized pups avoiding play wrestling. We conclude that social play does not reduce aggression in young meerkats. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All tights reserved.},

abstract = {Long-distance migrants have evolved specific adaptations that make their athletic records possible. Unique mechanisms explaining their amazing capacity for endurance exercise have now been uncovered, particularly with respect to energy storage, mobilization, transport and utilization. Birds are champions of migration because flying offers a key compromise: it allows more rapid movement than swimming, but has a lower cost of transport than running. High efficiency for muscle contraction, pointed wings, low wingloading, travelling in V-formations, storing fuel as energy-dense lipids and atrophy of non-essential organs are some of their strategies to decrease the cost of transport. The ability to process lipids rapidly also emerges as a crucial component of the migrant phenotype. High lipid fluxes are made possible by lipoprotein shuttles and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) that accelerate lipid transport and by upgrading the metabolic machinery for lipolysis and lipid oxidation. Preparation for long flights can include natural doping on n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) from unique invertebrate diets. Muscle performance is improved by restructuring membrane phospholipids and by activating key genes of lipid metabolism through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The physiological secret to long migrations does not depend on a single `magic' adaptation but on the integration of multiple adjustments in morphology, biomechanics, behavior, nutrition and metabolism. Research on the physiology of migrants improves the fundamental knowledge of exercise biology, but it also has important implications for wildlife conservation, treating obesity and improving the performance of human athletes.},

abstract = {Echolocating bats have successfully exploited a broad range of habitats and prey. Much research has demonstrated how time-frequency structure of echolocation calls of different species is adapted to acoustic constraints of habitats and foraging behaviors. However, the intensity of bat calls has been largely neglected although intensity is a key factor determining echolocation range and interactions with other bats and prey. Differences in detection range, in turn, are thought to constitute a mechanism promoting resource partitioning among bats, which might be particularly important for the species-rich bat assemblages in the tropics. Here we present data on emitted intensities for 11 species from 5 families of insectivorous bats from Panama hunting in open or background cluttered space or over water. We recorded all bats in their natural habitat in the field using a multi-microphone array coupled with photographic methods to assess the bats' position in space to estimate emitted call intensities. All species emitted intense search signals. Output intensity was reduced when closing in on background by 4-7 dB per halving of distance. Source levels of open space and edge space foragers (Emballonuridae, Mormoopidae, Molossidae, and Vespertilionidae) ranged between 122-134 dB SPL. The two Noctilionidae species hunting over water emitted the loudest signals recorded so far for any bat with average source levels of ca. 137 dB SPL and maximum levels above 140 dB SPL. In spite of this ten-fold variation in emitted intensity, estimates indicated, surprisingly, that detection distances for prey varied far less; bats emitting the highest intensities also emitted the highest frequencies, which are severely attenuated in air. Thus, our results suggest that bats within a local assemblage compensate for frequency dependent attenuation by adjusting the emitted intensity to achieve comparable detection distances for prey across species. We conclude that for bats with similar hunting habits, prey detection range represents a unifying constraint on the emitted intensity largely independent of call shape, body size, and close phylogenetic relationships.},

abstract = {Variation in male reproductive performance and success was studied over 2 years in a population of individually marked European treefrogs, Hyla arborea, a hylid frog with prolonged breeding season and a lek mating system. Reproductive success in males was not related to body size, age or growth rate, and there was no evidence for size- or age-assortative mating. Male mating success was significantly correlated with chorus attendance, that is, the number of nights spent calling at the breeding site. There were no significant differences with regard to body size, age or growth rate between males surviving to the next breeding season and those not surviving. However, surviving males showed a significantly higher chorus attendance than nonsurviving males, which is a novel finding for lekking anurans. Furthermore, males that survived from the previous breeding season spent significantly more nights calling at the breeding site than males that were observed for the first time. Since calling in frogs is costly, these results suggest that chorus attendance reflects male quality. The distribution of male mating success did not differ from a Poisson distribution, indicating a random mating pattern. Since male quality is related to chorus attendance, females that mate randomly are likely to mate with high-quality males and thereby gain indirect genetic benefits without incurring costs of extended mate searching and mate assessment. We suggest that a similar mating pattern is found in many lek-breeding hylid frogs in which male mating success is mainly determined by chorus attendance.

The multinomial distribution and the multinomial Dirichlet distribution (MDD) are widely accepted to model count data. We show that these two distributions cannot be the best choice in all the applications, and we propose another model called the multinomial generalized Dirichlet distribution (MGDD) that is the composition of the generalized Dirichlet distribution and the multinomial, in the same way that the MDD is the composition of the Dirichlet and the multinomial. The estimation of the parameters and the determination of the number of components in our model are based on the deterministic annealing expectation-maximization (DAEM) approach and the minimum description length (MDL) criterion, respectively. We compare our method to standard approaches such as multinomial and multinomial Dirichlet mixtures to show its merits.

abstract = {Rapid, effective communication between colony members is a key attribute that enables ants to live in dominant, fiercely protected societies. Their signals, however, may be mimicked by other insects that coexist as commensals with ants or interact with them as mutualists or social parasites. We consider the role of acoustics in ant communication and its exploitation by social parasites. Social parasitism has been studied mainly in the butterfly genus Maculinea, the final instar larvae of which are host-specific parasites of Myrmica ants, preying either on ant grubs (predatory Maculinea) or being fed by trophallaxis (cuckoo Maculinea). We found similar significant differences between the stridulations of model queen and worker ant castes in both Myrmica sabuleti and Myrmica scabrinodis to that previously reported for Myrmica schencki. However, the sounds made by queens of all three Myrmica species were indistinguishable, and among workers, stridulations did not differ significantly in two of three species-pairs tested. Sounds recorded from the predatory caterpillars and pupae of Maculinea arion had similar or closer patterns to the acoustics of their host Myrmica sabuleti than those previously reported for the cuckoo Maculinea rebeli and its host Myrmica schencki, even though Maculinea rebeli caterpillars live more intimately with their host. We conclude that chemical mimicry enables Maculinea larvae to be accepted as colony members by worker ants, but that caterpillars and pupae of both predatory and cuckoo butterflies employ acoustical mimicry of queen ant calls to elevate their status towards the highest attainable position within their host's social hierarchy.},

abstract = {The classic evidence for vocal production learning involves imitation of novel, often anthropogenic sounds. Among mammals, this has been reported for dolphins, elephants, harbor seals, and humans. A broader taxonomic distribution has been reported for vocal convergence, where the acoustic properties of calls from different individuals converge when they are housed together in captivity or form social bonds in the wild. Vocal convergence has been demonstrated for animals as diverse as songbirds, parakeets, hummingbirds, bats, elephants, cetaceans, and primates. For most species, call convergence is thought to reflect a group-distinctive identifier, with shared calls reflecting and strengthening social bonds. A ubiquitous function for vocal production learning that is starting to receive attention involves modifying signals to improve communication in a noisy channel. Pooling data on vocal imitation, vocal convergence, and compensation for noise suggests a wider taxonomic distribution of vocal production learning among mammals than has been generally appreciated. The wide taxonomic distribution of this evidence for vocal production learning suggests that perhaps more of the neural underpinnings for vocal production learning are in place in mammals than is usually recognized.

abstract = {Hair cell mechano-electric transducer (MET) channels play a pivotal role in auditory and vestibular signal detection, yet few data exist regarding their molecular nature. Present work characterizes the MET channel pore, a region whose properties are thought to be intrinsically determined. Two approaches were used. First, the channel was probed with antagonists of candidate channel subtypes including: cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, transient receptor potential channels and gap-junctional channels. Eight new antagonists were identified. Most of the effective antagonists had a partially charged amine group predicted to penetrate the channel pore, antagonizing current flow, while the remainder of the molecule prevented further permeation of the compound through the pore. This blocking mechanism was tested using curare to demonstrate the open channel nature of the block and by identifying methylene blue as a permeant channel blocker. The second approach estimated dimensions of the channel pore with simple amine compounds. The narrowest diameter of the pore was calculated as 12.5 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.8 A and the location of a binding site [{\~{}}]45{\%} of the way through the membrane electric field was calculated. Channel length was estimated as [{\~{}}]31 A and the width of the pore mouth at {\textless} 17 A. Each effective antagonist had a minimal diameter, measured about the penetrating amine, of less than the pore diameter, with a direct correlation between IC50 and minimal diameter. The IC50 was also directly related to the length of the amine side chains, further validating the proposed pore blocking mechanism. Data provided by these two approaches support a hypothesis regarding channel permeation and block that incorporates molecular dimensions and ion interactions within the pore.},

abstract = {An array of four hydrophones arranged in a symmetrical star configuration was used to measure the echolocation signals of the dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) near the Kaikoura Peninsula, New Zealand. Most of the echolocation signals had bi-modal frequency spectra with a low-frequency peak between 40 and 50 kHz and a high-frequency peak between 80 and 110 kHz. The low-frequency peak was dominant when the source level was low and the high frequency peak dominated when the source level was high. The center frequencies in the dusky broadband echolocation signals are among the highest of dolphins measured in the field. Peak-to-peak source levels as high as 210 dB re 1 muPa were measured, although the average was much lower in value. The levels of the echolocation signals are about 9-12 dB lower than for the larger white-beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) which belongs to the same genus but is over twice as heavy as the dusky dolphins. The source level varied in amplitude approximately as a function of the one-way transmission loss for signals traveling from the animals to the array. The wave form and spectrum of the echolocation signals were similar to those of other dolphins measured in the field. (C) 2004 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {Assessments of sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus abundance based on invalid analyses of whaling data are common in the literature. Modern visual surveys have produced population estimates for a total of 24{\%} of the sperm whale's global habitat. I corrected these assessments for whales missed on the track line and then used 3 methods to scale up to a global population. Scaling using habitat area, plots of 19th century catches and primary production produced consistent global population estimates of about 360 000 whales (CV = 0.36). This is approximately 20{\%} of the numbers reproduced in current literature from invalid whaling-based estimates. A population model, based on that used by the International Whaling Commission's Scientific Committee, and which considers uncertainty in population parameters and catch data, was used to estimate population trajectories. Results suggest that pre-whaling numbers were about 1 110 000 whales (95{\%} CI: 672 000 to 1 512 000), and that the population was about 71{\%} (95{\%} CI 52 to 100{\%}) of its original level in 1880 as open-boat whaling drew to a close and about 32{\%} (95{\%} CI: 19 to 62{\%}) of its original level in 1999, 10 yr after the end of large-scale hunting. Thus, widely held views about the status of sperm whale populations need considerable revision.},

abstract = {This study examined the activities of "northern resident" killer whales (Orcinus orca) in Johnstone Strait, British Columbia, Canada, in July and August, from 1995 to 2002. Disturbance from boat traffic has been identified as a conservation concern for this population. The primary aims of the study were to test whether boat presence altered whales' activities, and if so, to estimate whether behavioural responses were likely to have carried energetic costs. A land-based observation site near a vessel-exclusion marine protected area allowed us to conduct a natural experiment to monitor whale activities in the presence and absence of boats. Using Time-Discrete Markov Chain models, boat presence was linked to significant changes in the probability that focal whales would switch from one activity state to another, which led to significantly different activity budgets in the presence and absence of boats. We estimated that the energetic cost of meeting these budgets differed by only 3-4{\%}. In the presence of boats, however, whales reduced their time spent feeding and the time spent rubbing their bodies on smooth pebble beaches. These lost feeding opportunities could have resulted in a substantial (18{\%}) estimated decrease in energy intake. Our sensitivity analysis provides preliminary evidence that disturbance could carry higher costs to killer whales in terms of reducing energy acquisition than increasing energetic demand, and future research should address this directly. Meanwhile, our observations suggest that protected areas would confer greatest conservation benefit to endangered killer whale populations if they were designed to protect important foraging areas.

Our observations suggest that at least some of these animals may constitute a resident population, although the extent of the resident group{\&}apos;s home range has not been determined. Twenty-eight rough-toothed dolphins were identified using photo-identification techniques, 15 of which were re-sighted on two or more occasions. The 12 animals that were re-sighted four or more times were typically seen together, suggesting that they constitute a stable social group. At least one of these dolphins is an adult male, and his continued presence in this social group may reflect a social structure for rough-toothed dolphins that differs from that described for other dolphin species. Social interactions often involved tactile behaviours such as pectoral fin rubbing and side rubbing. The observed dolphins sometimes expressed interest in the research vessel and other boats by approaching, and on separate occasions examined a hydrophone and slow moving propeller visually and echoically. Overall, our behavioural observations suggest: (1) synchronous behaviours and {\&}lsquo;tight{\&}rsquo; groupings are common while rough-toothed dolphins are travelling; (2) tactile contact is an important aspect of social interactions for rough-toothed dolphins; (3) cooperative behaviour occurs during play; and (4) rough-toothed dolphins are curious.},

abstract = {Pseudoreplication (the pooling fallacy) is a widely acknowledged statistical error in the behavioural sciences. Taking a large number of data points from a small number of animals creates a false impression of a better representation of the population. Studies of communication may be particularly prone to artificially inflating the data set in this way, as the unit of interest (the facial expression, the call or the gesture) is a tempting unit of analysis. Primate communication studies (551) published in scientific journals from 1960 to 2008 were examined for the simplest form of pseudoreplication (taking more than one data point from each individual). Of the studies that used inferential statistics, 38{\%} presented at least one case of pseudoreplicated data. An additional 16{\%} did not provide enough information to rule out pseudoreplication. Generalized linear mixed models determined that one variable significantly increased the likelihood of pseudoreplication: using observational methods. Actual sample size (number of animals) and year of publication were not associated with pseudoreplication. The high prevalence of pseudoreplication in the primate communication research articles, and the fact that there has been no decline since key papers warned against pseudoreplication, demonstrates that the problem needs to be more actively addressed.},

abstract = {In January 2003, the US Environmental Protection Agency sponsored a “roundtable discussion” to develop a consensus on the relationship between eutrophication and harmful algal blooms (HABs), specifically targeting those relationships for which management actions may be appropriate. Academic, federal, and state agency representatives were in attendance. The following seven statements were unanimously adopted by attendees based on review and analysis of current as well as pertinent previous data: (1) Degraded water quality from increased nutrient pollution promotes the development and persistence of many HABs and is one of the reasons for their expansion in the U.S. and other nations; (2) The composition–not just the total quantity–of the nutrient pool impacts HABs; (3) High-biomass blooms must have exogenous nutrients to be sustained; (4) Both chronic and episodic nutrient delivery promote HAB development; (5) Recently developed tools and techniques are already improving the detection of some HABs, and emerging technologies are rapidly advancing toward operational status for the prediction of HABs and their toxins; (6) Experimental studies are critical to further the understanding about the role of nutrients in HABs expression, and will strengthen prediction and mitigation of HABs; and (7) Management of nutrient inputs to the watershed can lead to significant reduction in HABs. Supporting evidence and pertinent examples for each consensus statement are provided herein.},

abstract = {Many optimal foraging models for diving animals examine strategies that maximize time spent in the foraging zone, assuming that prey acquisition increases linearly with search time. Other models have considered the effect of patch quality and predict a net energetic benefit if dives where no prey is encountered early in the dive are abandoned. For deep divers, however, the energetic benefit of giving up is reduced owing to the elevated energy costs associated with descending to physiologically hostile depths, so patch residence time should be invariant. Others consider an asymptotic gain function where the decision to leave a patch is driven by patch-depletion effects - the marginal value theorem. As predator behaviour is increasingly being used as an index of marine resource density and distribution, it is important to understand the nature of this gain function. We investigated the dive behaviour of the world's deepest-diving seal, the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina, in response to patch quality. Testing these models has largely been limited to controlled experiments on captive animals. By integrating in situ measurements of the seal's relative lipid content obtained from drift rate data (a measure of foraging success) with area-restricted search behaviour identified from first-passage time analysis, we identified regions of high- and low-quality patches. Dive durations and bottom times were not invariant and did not increase in regions of high quality; rather, both were longer when patches were of relatively low quality. This is consistent with the predictions of the marginal value theorem and provides support for a nonlinear relationship between search time and prey acquisition. We also found higher descent and ascent rates in high-quality patches suggesting that seals minimized travel time to the foraging patch when quality was high; however, this was not achieved by increasing speed or dive angle. Relative body lipid content was an important predictor of dive behaviour. Seals did not schedule their diving to maximize time spent in the foraging zone in higher-quality patches, challenging the widely held view that maximizing time in the foraging zone translates to greater foraging success.},

abstract = {Songs of many songbird species consist of variable sequences of a finite number of syllables. A common approach for characterizing the syntax of these complex syllable sequences is to use transition probabilities between the syllables. This is equivalent to the Markov model, in which each syllable is associated with one state, and the transition probabilities between the states do not depend on the state transition history. Here we analyze the song syntax in Bengalese finch. We show that the Markov model fails to capture the statistical properties of the syllable sequences. Instead, a state transition model that accurately describes the statistics of the syllable sequences includes adaptation of the self-transition probabilities when states are revisited consecutively, and allows associations of more than one state to a given syllable. Such a model does not increase the model complexity significantly. Mathematically, the model is a partially observable Markov model with adaptation (POMMA). The success of the POMMA supports the branching chain network model of how syntax is controlled within the premotor song nucleus HVC, but also suggests that adaptation and many-to-one mapping from the syllable-encoding chain networks in HVC to syllables should be included in the network model.},

abstract = {Naval sonar systems produce signals which may affect the behavior of harbor porpoises, though their effect may be reduced by ambient noise. To show how natural ambient noise influences the effect of sonar sweeps on porpoises, a porpoise in a pool was exposed to 1-s duration up-sweeps, similar in frequency range (6-7 kHz) to those of existing naval sonar systems. The sweep signals had randomly generated sweep intervals of 3-7 s (duty cycle: 19{\%}). Behavioral parameters during exposure to signals were compared to those during baseline periods. The sessions were conducted under five background noise conditions: the local normal ambient noise and four conditions mimicking the spectra for wind-generated noise at Sea States 2-8. In all conditions, the sweeps caused the porpoise to swim further away from the transducer, surface more often, swim faster, and breathe more forcefully than during the baseline periods. However, the higher the background noise level, the smaller the effects of the sweeps on the surfacing behavior of the porpoise. Therefore, the effects of naval sonar systems on harbor porpoises are determined not only by the received level of the signals and the hearing sensitivity of the animals but also by the background noise.},

abstract = {The potential for seismic airgun "shots" to cause acoustic trauma in marine mammals is poorly understood. There are just two empirical measurements of temporary threshold shift (TTS) onset levels from airgun-like sounds in odontocetes. Considering these limited data, a model was developed examining the impact of individual variability and uncertainty on risk assessment of baleen whale TTS from seismic surveys. In each of 100 simulations: 10000 "whales" are assigned TTS onset levels accounting for: inter-individual variation; uncertainty over the population's mean; and uncertainty over weighting of odontocete data to obtain baleen whale onset levels. Randomly distributed whales are exposed to one seismic survey passage with cumulative exposure level calculated. In the base scenario, 29{\%} of whales (5th/95th percentiles of 10{\%}/62{\%}) approached to 1-1.2 km range were exposed to levels sufficient for TTS onset. By comparison, no whales are at risk outside 0.6 km when uncertainty and variability are not considered. Potentially "exposure altering" parameters (movement, avoidance, surfacing, and effective quiet) were also simulated. Until more research refines model inputs, the results suggest a reasonable likelihood that whales at a kilometer or more from seismic surveys could potentially be susceptible to TTS and demonstrate that the large impact uncertainty and variability can have on risk assessment.},

A cornerstone of this ability is their use of short, broadband pulses produced in the region of the upper nasal passages. Here we provide empirical evidence that a beluga whale () uses two signal generators simultaneously when echolocating. We show that the pulses of the two generators are combined as they are transmitted through the melon to produce a single echolocation click emitted from the front of the animal. Generating two pulses probably offers the beluga the ability to control the energy and frequency distribution of the emitted click and may allow it to acoustically steer its echolocation beam.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic hearing is widespread among moths, but very few moth species have been reported to produce ultrasounds for sexual communication. In those that do, the signals are intense and thus well matched for long distance communication. By contrast, males of the Asian corn borer moth (Crambidae) were recently shown to whisper extremely low-intensity ultrasonic courtship songs close to females. Since low sound levels will prevent eavesdropping by predators, parasites and conspecific rivals, we predicted low intensity ultrasound communication to be widespread among moths. Here we tested 13 species of moths including members of the Noctuidae, Arctiidae, Geometridae and Crambidae. Males of nine species, 70{\%}, produced broadband ultrasound close to females. Peak frequencies ranged from 38 to above 100 kHz. All sounds were of low intensity, 43-76 dB SPL at 1 cm [64{\{}+/-{\}}10 dB peSPL (mean {\{}+/-{\}} s.d.), N=9 species]. These quiet and/or hyper-frequency ultrasounds are audible to nearby mates, but inaudible to unintended receivers. Although largely unknown because it is so inconspicuous, acoustic communication using low intensity ultrasound appears to be widespread among hearing moths. Thus, acoustic communication may be the norm rather than the exception.},

abstract = {A field experiment with Dukane NetMark(TM) 1000 pingers was conducted in the bottom-set gillnet fishery for cod in the Swedish Skagerrak Sea between March and April 1997. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate (i) the effectiveness of pingers to reduce by-catch rate of harbour porpoises, and (ii) the effects of pingers on the catches of the target species in the fishery. The design of the study was based on a statistical power analysis and the results from observer programmes conducted 1995-1996 in the same area, fishery and time of year. The catches of cod, pollack and other fish species were not affected by the sound of the pingers in the active strings. No harbour porpoise was caught in any control or active string, which was a significantly lower by-catch rate than in the two previous years. This could not be explained by a reduction in fishing effort per se, a difference in the total catch of fish for consumption or a shift in the spatial distribution of the sets between the observer programmes and the pinger experiment. However, the spatial analyses demonstrated that the experimental strings were set parallel to the coast and along the 50 m isobath, and that the audible range of the active pingers on average covered 16{\%} of the longitudinal length and 5{\%} of the surface area of the experimental fishing area. A compilation. of herring landings by Swedish fishermen operating in the Skagerrak Sea 1995-1997 suggests that herring were more abundant in 1997 than in 1,995. Good access to food in other parts of the porpoises' distribution range and an aversive reaction to the ensonification could have caused their displacement in the fishing area. A displacement effect by pingers is likely to be more prominent in coastal waters where access to bodies of water is limited and the consequence may be serious if the area is critical to the survival of the porpoise population.

The bird's call was compared to a digital representation of the call stored in a computer to determine a match. Once birds were responding at a high level of precision, we measured the effect of several manipulations upon the accuracy and the intensity of call production. Also, by differentially reinforcing other aspects of vocal behavior, budgerigars were trained to produce a call that matched another bird's contact call and to alter the latency of their vocal response. Both the accuracy of vocal matching and the intensity level of vocal production increased significantly when the bird could hear the template immediately before each trial. Moreover, manipulating the delay between the presentation of an acoustic reference and the onset of vocal production did not significantly affect either vocal intensity or matching accuracy. Interestingly, the vocalizations learned and reinforced in these operant experiments were only occasionally used in more natural communicative situations, such as when birds called back and forth to one another in their home cages.},

abstract = {Although electrophysiological methods of measuring the hearing sensitivity of pinnipeds are not yet as refined as those for dolphins and porpoises, they appear to be a promising supplement to traditional psychophysical procedures. In order to further standardize electrophysiological methods with pinnipeds, a within-subject comparison of psychophysical and auditory steady-state response (ASSR) measures of aerial hearing sensitivity was conducted with a 1.5-yr-old California sea lion. The psychophysical audiogram was similar to those previously reported for otariids, with a U-shape, and thresholds near 10 dB re 20 $\mu$Pa at 8 and 16 kHz. ASSR thresholds measured using both single and multiple simultaneous amplitude-modulated tones closely reproduced the psychophysical audiogram, although the mean ASSR thresholds were elevated relative to psychophysical thresholds. Differences between psychophysical and ASSR thresholds were greatest at the low- and high-frequency ends of the audiogram. Thresholds measured using the multiple ASSR method were not different from those measured using the single ASSR method. The multiple ASSR method was more rapid than the single ASSR method, and allowed for threshold measurements at seven frequencies in less than 20 min. The multiple ASSR method may be especially advantageous for hearing sensitivity measurements with otariid subjects that are untrained for psychophysical procedures.},

abstract = {We conducted hydroacoustic surveys for capelin Mallotus villosus in Witless Bay, Newfoundland, Canada, on 61 days during the summers of 1983 to 1985. On 32 of those days in which capelin surveys were conducted, we observed a total of 129 baleen whales - including 93 humpback Megaptera novaeangliae , 3 minke Balaenoptera acutorostrata and 5 fin whales B. physalus . Although a few whales were observed when capelin schools were scarce, the majority (96{\%}) of whales were observed when mean daily capelin densities exceeded 5 schools per linear km surveyed (range of means over 3 yr: 0.0 to 14.0 schools km super(-1)). Plots of daily whale abundance (no. h super(-1) surveyed) vs daily capelin school density (mean no. schools km super(-1) surveyed) in each summer revealed that baleen whales have a threshold foraging response to capelin density. Thresholds were estimated using a simple iterative step-function model. Foraging thresholds of baleen whales (7.3, 5.0, and 5.8 school schools km super(1-)) varied between years in relation to the overall abundance of capelin schools in the study area during summer (means of 7.2, 3.3, and 5.3 schools km super(-1), respectively).  },

The species is endemic to the Amazonian region, being distributed throughout the Amazon basin, occurring mainly in calm waters and lakes. The species has been commercially exploited since 1542, with the meat and hide being the main products extracted. This commercial exploitation, combined with their very low reproductive rate, has seriously reduced the manatee population. Therefore the Amazonian Manatee is now considered an endangered species. Although it is protected by most of the countries where it occurs, there is no law enforcement, and the species is still captured throughout the Amazon.

Acclimated salmon were exposed to a series of 10 underwater explosions over 70 min, each of 22432 MPa in pressure amplitude, in a laboratory tank. No mortality occurred immediately or during the subsequent 7 days of observation. The response to each of the 10 detonations was cessation of swimming for a few minutes and failure to express a flight reaction. Structurally, the vascular endothelium of the ventral aorta (VA) and the coeliaco mesenteric artery (CMA) revealed signs of injury within the first 30 min after the experimental shock. In contrast to vessels from the controls, the injury was further aggravated by the mounting procedure for tension recording. The endothelial impairment was temporary, persisting throughout the first days while being restored after 1 week. Functionally, the cholinergic and adrenergic vasoconstrictor responses in the CMA were markedly reduced during the first day after the shock. These responses were similar to those observed in the endothelium probed CMA of controls. The loss of structural integrity and the reduced functional responses indicated a temporary impairment of the vascular endothelium in response to this experimental simulation of a seismic shock. The primary stress hormones, adrenaline and cortisol, were not immediately elevated in plasma, but revealed different patterns of delayed increases. The head kidney content of catecholamines was not altered by the acoustic shock, while the atrial uptake of both calecholamines declined progressively during the 48 h of observation. Plasma chloride was not affected.},

Each dolphin was trained a behavior requiring it to swim across an enclosure, touch a paddle, and return to the starting location. Ten-trial control and exposure sessions were performed with each dolphin. Dolphins were placed into one of five groups, each of which received a 115, 130, 145, 160, 175 or 185dB re 1$\mu$Pa (rms) sound pressure level (SPL) exposure while crossing the enclosure on exposure trials. A canonical correlation analysis was used to determine the set of behavioral responses most interrelated with the independent variables of exposure level, trial number, and age. Responses that significantly contributed to the canonical model were used to create dose–response functions based on the received SPL. Dose–response functions demonstrated a robust relationship between received SPL and the probability of response and indicated rapid habituation to repetitive exposures with received SPL≤160dB. No habituation was observed at received SPL≥175dB re 1$\mu$Pa and all dolphins refused to participate in trials when the received SPL=185dB re 1$\mu$Pa. Although bottlenose dolphins may rapidly habituate to sound exposures below a certain level, particularly if there is food motivation, abandonment of behaviors increases rapidly at received levels≥175dB re 1$\mu$Pa.},

abstract = {Whistles are narrowband, frequency-modulated sounds produced by many cetaceans. Whistles are extensively studied in delphinids, where several factors have been proposed to explain between- and within-species variation. We examined factors associated with geographic variation in whistles of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) by assessing the role of ambient noise, noise from boats, and sympatry with other dolphin species, and reviewing and comparing whistle structure across populations in the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean. Whistles of adjacent populations differed, particularly in frequency parameters. A combination of factors may contribute to microgeographic whistle variation, including differences in ambient noise levels (dolphins produced relatively higher frequency whistles in the noisiest habitat), and differences in number of boats present (when multiple boats were present, dolphins whistled with greater frequency modulation and whistles were higher in maximum frequency and longer than when a single boat was present). Whistles produced by adjacent populations were relatively similar in structure. However, for clearly separated populations, the distance between them did not relate directly to whistle structure. We propose that plasticity in bottlenose dolphin whistles facilitates adaptation to local and changing conditions of their habitat, thus promoting variation between populations at different geographic scales.},

abstract = {Singing is a complex form of communicating, incorporating two classes of signaling specializations with distinctive properties: primary signal units, and formal rules governing sequential order in sustained performances. The properties of each class enable it to provide its own characteristic kinds of information. As a fundamental procedure used in a wide range of circumstances, singing has many functions and is a major part of the communication of an enormous spectrum of animals. Yet recognition of singing's breadth and informative potential is commonly obscured by involved and inadequate definitions and use of one term, "song", to cover both the components of singing and the formal sequencing rules. A simple, operationally defined distinction between sustained performances and their components is proposed herein, and its implications are examined. Sustained orderly singing performances are particularly useful for communicating at a distance, often obviating closer encounters. None the less, because singing provides information continuously it can also operate in close, nearly stable interactions (rapidly changing events disrupt or preclude singing). Each component signal of a performance usually provides information about a singer's identity, location and behavior, and different components can provide different information about behavior. The pattern in which the components are sung can reveal relative probabilities of different actions and the rates and directions of changes in those probabilities. The elaboration of singing that provides such information cannot be explained simply as a result of sexual selection or other postulates that assume almost total redundancy of components. Contrary to many existing definitions, singing is not limited by complexity of component form, the gender or age of performers, or season. It functions much more widely than is generally understood, for example, in parent-offspring interactions, mobbing, and vigilance behavior. Much singing that goes unrecognized because it incorporates signal units that are not "songs" is revealed by distinguishing between the properties of sustained performances and the very different properties of their components. Even non-vocal signaling sequences can be formally similar to singing.},

abstract = {Abstract Intrapopulational polymorphism in habitat use is widely reported in many animal species. The phenomenon has recently also been recognized in adult female loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta, with small females tending to inhabit oceanic areas (where water depths are {\textgreater}200 m) while presumably feeding pelagically and large females tending to inhabit neritic areas (where depths are {\textless}200 m) while presumably feeding benthically. In this study, dive recording satellite telemetry units were used to verify their foraging and diving behaviours in these habitats. Two females that nested on Yakushima Island, Japan, were tracked for 124 and 197 days. The small female wandered in the oceanic Pacific, and spent most of the time at 0–25 m depths regardless of day or night, implying that she foraged pelagically at the surface and shallow depths. Her mean dive durations were significantly longer at night than during the day. The large female moved into the neritic East China Sea, and spent most of the time over the continental shelf at 100–150 m depths during the day and at 0–25 m depths at night, suggesting that she alternated between diurnal benthic foraging and nocturnal resting within the depths where she could attain neutral buoyancy. Her mean dive durations were not significantly different between day and night. The increase in dive duration for both turtles coincided with a seasonal decrease in water temperature. The small female sometimes showed midwater dormancy at 0–25 m depths with a duration of {\textgreater}5 h that was in contrast with bottom dormancy by sea turtles inhabiting other regions. The diving behaviours observed during this study were consistent with their estimated main feeding habits, which demonstrated resource polymorphism in a marine reptile.},

abstract = {This overview assesses some distinguishing features of the cetacean (whale, dolphin, porpoise) air sac system that may relate to the anatomy and function of the paranasal sinuses in terrestrial mammals. The cetacean respiratory tract has been modified through evolution to accommodate living in water. Lack of paranasal sinuses in modern cetaceans may be a diving adaptation. Bone-enclosed air chambers are detrimental, as their rigid walls may fracture during descent/ascent due to contracting/re-expanding air volumes. Flexible-walled ldquosinusesrdquo (extracranial diverticula) are a logical adaptation to diving. Odontocetes (toothed whales) exhibit several pairs of paranasal air sacs. Although fossil evidence indicates that paranasal sinuses occur in archaeocetes (ancestors/relatives of living cetaceans), it is not known whether the paranasal sacs derive from these sinuses. Sac pigmentation indicates that they derived from invaginations of the integument. Unlike sinuses, paranasal sacs are not circumferentially enclosed in bone, and therefore can accommodate air volume changes that accompany diving pressure changes. Paired pterygoid sacs, located ventrally along the cetacean skull, connect the pharynx and middle ear cavities. Mysticetes (baleen whales) have a large midline laryngeal sac. Although cetacean air sacs do not appear to be homologous to paranasal sinuses, they may serve some analogous respiratory, vocal, or structural functions. For example, these sacs may participate in gas exchange, thermoregulation, resonance, and skeletal pneumatization. In addition, they may subserve unique aquatic functions, such as increasing inspiratory volume, mitigating pressure-induced volume change, air shunting to reduce respiratory dead space, and facilitating underwater sound production and transmission.

Recordings and observations were conducted inside the estuary and in adjacent coastal waters using single hydrophones between 1987 and 2000. In the groups sampled, the mean number of whistles emitted per minute per animal was 0.28. The acoustic characteristics of a sample of 735 whistles were measured and compared with data from other Tursiops populations, showing that, in a pattern of overall similarity, the whistles recorded in the Sado are relatively long and the frequency range used is relatively wide. Mean peak frequency was 9.2 kHz. About 30{\%} of the whistles were stereotyped, and remarkable stability was found in several contours over a 12-year period. No relation was found between dolphin group size and whistle rate, suggesting some restriction in production; and no relation was found between dolphin group size and the emission of different contours. Significant variation was found between episodes of simple travel and more aroused activities in terms of the production of whistles in general and also of different whistle contours.  },

Acoustic analysis shows that the optimal communication frequency is inversely proportional to about the 0.4 power of the animal's body mass. Comparison with observational data indicates that this prediction is well supported in practice. For animals of a given class, for example mammals, the maximum communication distance varies about as the 0.6 power of the animal's mass.

abstract = {Recent mass strandings of marine mammals, mostly Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) from the family of ziphiidae, have occurred coincident in space and time with human production of high levels of underwater sound. Three of these events, the May 1996 mass stranding along the Greek coast, the Bahamas mass stranding event in March 2000 and the September 2002 event in the Canary Islands, were selected for consideration here since pertinent information was readily available. The purpose of this paper is to summarise the probable characteristics of the sound fields during these events and to search for common features. The acoustic sources in all three cases moved at speeds of 5 knots or greater and generated periodic sequences of high amplitude, transient pulses 15-60s apart that contained significant energy in the 1-10kHz frequency band. The environmental conditions included water depths exceeding 1km close to land. In addition, the depth dependence of the ocean sound speed created an acoustic waveguide whose lower boundary was formed by refraction within the water column. The anthropogenic sources in all cases were located within such waveguides. Under these conditions, sound levels decrease more slowly with increasing range after a certain transition range than otherwise, due to sound focusing and to decreased attenuation because of isolation over extended ranges from the ocean bottom. In addition, the frequency dispersion is such that pulses tend to remain as pulses during propagation. For those events involving near-surface sources in surface ducts, weather conditions were calm leading to minimal sound attenuation and scattering by near-surface bubbles and ocean surface roughness. Quantitative prediction of the actual sound field properties during these events is limited primarily by the lack of knowledge of prevailing environmental conditions. Results from simple numerical modelling show that received sound level increases of up to 20dB occur after the transition range for sources and receivers within refractive waveguides. Data-based semi-empirical models of surface duct propagation provide simple, realistic, quantitative estimates of the mean acoustic field in the duct and the effects of changes in environmental conditions. Numerical modelling of total sound exposure (pressure squared integrated with respect to time) illustrates the importance of the relative velocity and minimum range between source and receiver, indicating that realistic animal motion models are required to obtain representative results. Although several features of the sound fields during these three mass stranding events are very similar, their actual relationship to the strandings is unknown.},

Similar to other European pipistrelles, the frequency structure during foraging varied. During the search phase, the bats emitted long shallow frequency-modulated pulses 9-11 ms in duration, whereas the maximum pulse duration of the bats approaching a large target wall in the laboratory was 3 ms. No significant difference was observed between decreases in the interpulse interval during these two approach flights. It is concluded that the bats use a long quasi-constant frequency pulse to find a weak echo from a small prey target. (C) 2008 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {Testicular and ovarian development in neonatal and juvenile harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena was examined, using tissue from animals (males n = 65 and females n = 10) stranded or caught off the coast of England and Wales. Classification of the animals according to their stage of sexual development was undertaken using characteristics of gonadal morphology. Developmental correlates of the immature testis were increased incidence of prespermatogonia in seminiferous tubules, and the increasing proportion of testicular volume occupied by the seminiferous tubules. Using a low magnification (x 200) assessment of testis sections, immature specimens could be grouped into three developmentally distinct classes, based on the relative amounts of interstitial and seminiferous tubule tissue and the frequency of prespermatogonia. Adult testes, showing either active spermatogenesis or seasonal quiescence, could be clearly distinguished from immature testes using histological criteria such as the presence of spermatocytes and spermatids. This classification system was used to determine relationships between testicular development and body size: males were classified as immature when they had body lengths {\textless} 135 cm and body weights {\textless} 30 kg; mature males always exceeded 140 cm in length and 40 kg in weight; and a transitional group, which was regarded as juvenile, had body lengths between 110 and 140 cm and body weights between 20 and 40 kg. Ovarian morphology was used to distinguish neonatal and juvenile females. Neonates displayed characteristic cords of naked ova which dispersed as development progressed. Neonatal animals had body lengths {\textless} 100 cm and body weights {\textless} 18 kg; within this group (n = 5) there were significant (P {\textless} 0.01) left-right asymmetries in the number of naked ova present, the left ovary containing nearly twice as many ova as the right. Although this difference was not apparent in females with body lengths {\textgreater} 100 cm and body weights between 19 and 30 kg (juveniles) it could be related to the almost total asymmetry of ovulation from the left ovary in this species (Harrison, Brownwell {\&} Boice, 1972).},

abstract = {Powerboats are potentially a significant source of disturbance to coastal cetaceans. Information is scarce, however, on the nature of interactions between powerboats and dolphins, particularly when both surface and acoustic behaviour are combined. The surface behaviour and acoustic response of travelling dolphins to approaches by a powerboat were assessed by a series of experimental trials between November 2001 and November 2003 in Jervis Bay, New South Wales, Australia. Dolphin behaviour was monitored continuously from an independent research boat before, during and after a powerboat approached (n = 12). Treatments were interspersed with control observations (n = 12). Changes in surface behaviour indicated differences between the treatment and control periods (z = 2.24, p = 0.025), with dolphins tending to alter their surface behaviour when exposed to the powerboat approach. Analysis also revealed a change in the direction of travel by dolphin groups when approached (z = 3.22, p = 0.001). Changes in surface behaviour occurred at vessel approach distances outside the minimum approach distance of 30 m for recreational and commercial vessels, as proposed by the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service. In contrast, there were no changes in dolphin whistle rates (F3,12 = 0.74, p = 0.54) or the duration of echolocation click bouts (F3,12 = 0.76, p = 0.59) when approached. These findings indicate that powerboats do affect the surface behaviour and direction of travelling inshore bottlenose dolphins in Jervis Bay; however it appears that this impact is not reflected in their acoustic behaviour.},

abstract = {A nine-day acoustic and visual survey was conducted off the West Indies in March 1994 to study the pulse trains that were detected on SOSUS arrays throughout winter in deep water between the West Indies and Bermuda. During the survey, pulse train sounds were consistently recorded in an area 1902013350 km northeast of Puerto Rico. Vocalizing animals were never visually observed, but visual sighting conditions were often poor and observation height was low. Pulse trains occurred in two basic forms. The "speed-up" pulse train was characterized by an accelerating series of pulses with energy in the 2002013400 Hz band, with individual pulses lasting 40-60 msec. Speedup pulse trains started with average pulse rates of 1.5 pulses/sec, lasted 43.7 ± 6.0 sec, and ended with average pulse rates of 2.8 pulses/sec. The less common "slow-down" pulse train was characterized by a decelerating series of pulses with energy in the 250-350 Hz band. Slow-down pulse trains started at pulse rates averaging 4.5 pulses/sec, lasted 60.9 ± 5.8 sec, and ended with average pulse rates of 2.9 pulses/sec. We believe the recorded pulse trains are from minke whales based on careful reanalysis of, and comparison to, minke whale pulse-train sounds recorded in the Caribbean by Winn and Perkins (1976).},

We examine the assumptions that underlie these approaches to assessing covariate effects on the mean of a continuous, dichotomous or count outcome. Access to statistical software to implement these models has led to widespread application in numerous disciplines. However, careful consideration should be paid to their critical assumptions to ascertain which model might be appropriate in a given setting. To illustrate similarities and differences that might exist in empirical results, we use a study that assessed depressive symptoms in low-income pregnant women using a structured instrument with up to five assessments that spanned the pre-natal and post-natal periods. Understanding the conceptual differences between the methods is important in their proper application even though empirically they might not differ substantively. The choice of model in specific applications would depend on the relevant questions being addressed, which in turn informs the type of design and data collection that would be relevant.},

Sensory cells are represented by scattered, ciliated primary cells (sending their own axons to the cerebral ganglion) or secondary sensory cells (axonless cells forming afferent and efferent synapses with neurons, whose somata are located in the ganglion) of the coronal organ. Coronal cells have varying morphologies: in species of the Enterogona order, they are multiciliate, whereas those of Pleurogona possess an apical apparatus composed of one or two cilia accompanied by stereovilli, in some cases also graded in length. The coronal organ has been proposed as a homologue to the vertebrate octavo-lateralis system, because coronal cells resemble vertebrate hair cells for morphology, embryonic origin and arrangement. In the ascidian Molgula socialis (Pleurogona), we now describe the morphology of the coronal organ, which contains a few associated rows of sensory cells that run the whole length of the oral velum and the branched tentacles. Three kinds of sensory cells, accompanied by specialised supporting cells, are present. Comparisons between the coronal organ and other chordate mechanosensory structures suggest that hair cells originated in the common ancestor of chordates.},

abstract = {Hjellvik, V., Handegard, N. O., and Ona, E. 2008. Correcting for vessel avoidance in acoustic-abundance estimates for herring. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 1036-1045. When a research vessel passes over a school or layer of herring (Clupea harengus), the fish may avoid the vessel by swimming downwards and horizontally. If the orientation of the fish is changed in this process, the mean target strength may also be altered. Consequently, the echo abundance measured by the relatively narrow echosounder beam does not always reflect the true density of the school in the undisturbed situation. This avoidance behaviour has been quantified in several experiments where a stationary, submerged transducer has been used to measure the changes in echo abundance during the passage of a survey vessel. Two approaches for correcting the echo abundance for avoidance are presented. The first is to correct in each depth layer separately, but this does not account for diving during vessel passage. The second is to correct the total echo abundance based on the mean depth of the fish at passage. Generalized linear models are fitted to the experimental data in both approaches. The parameters are estimated with uncertainty, which is taken into account when the fitted models are used for correcting standard survey data. The models were fitted to data from various experiments conducted during the period 1996-2004. The avoidance response differed strongly between experiments, indicating that correction factors estimated from one specific experiment should not be used uncritically in a standard correction procedure.},

The different types of nets included (a) standard commercial monofilament gillnet used in the salmon mothership fishery, (b) prototype hollow core monofilament net, (c) Macah tribal cord setnet, and (d) multifilament nets.  Target strength measurements were made at four angles of incidence, 0-degrees (normal to net), 15-degrees, 30-degrees, and 45-degrees.  The standard gillnet had the smallest target strength which was relatively independent of the angle of incidence.  The target strength based on the peak-to-peak values of the echoes varied from -59 to -62 dB.  Using echo energy within the integration time of Tursiops truncatus, the target strength was found to be between -54 and -59 dB.  Biosonar detection ranges for different sea state conditions were estimated using the noise-limited form of the sonar equation and target detection data obtained for Tursiops truncatus in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii.  The results suggest that an echolocating dolphin should be able to detect a gillnet at ranges long enough to avoid entanglement, even in sea state 6 conditions.  Several possibilities for the seeming inability of dolphins to detect gillnets are discussed.},

abstract = {Threshold shifts (TS) were measured at various times following a wide variety of noise exposures on over 900 chinchillas. An analysis of postexposure TS measures and noise-induced permanent threshold shift (PTS) showed that, across audiometric test frequency, there was a consistent relation between these variables of the form PTS (dB) = alpha(e(TS/beta) - 1), where, for a given test frequency, alpha (dB) and beta (dB) are constants. TSs were measured immediately following exposure (TS0), 24 h after exposure (TS24), and at several intermediate times in order to estimate the maximum TS (TSmax). Correlation between TS and PTS at the various test frequencies was highest for TS24. An analysis of the 90th-percentile PTS showed a linear growth of PTS with TS24 of approximately 0.7 dB PTS/dB TS24. These data provide some support, in the chinchilla model, for a variation of the three postulates originally presented by Kryter et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 39, 451 (1966)]. Specifically: (i) TS24 is a consistent measure of the effects of a traumatic noise exposure. (ii) All exposures that produce a given TS24 will be equally hazardous. (iii) Noise-induced PTS in the most susceptible animals, following many years of exposure, is approximately equal to (0.7)TS24 measured after an 8-h exposure to the same noise.},

Most of the 19 experimental feeding events that occurred during the 51 dives recorded resulted in specific acceleration patterns that were clearly distinguishable from swimming accelerations. The differential acceleration between the head-mounted and jaw-mounted accelerometers detected 84{\%} of prey captures on the vertical axis and 89{\%} on the horizontal axis. However, the jaw-mounted accelerometer alone proved to be equally effective at detecting prey capture attempts. Acceleration along the horizontal (surge)-axis appeared to be particularly efficient in detecting prey captures, and suggests that a single accelerometer placed under the jaw of a pinniped is a promising and easily implemented means of recording prey capture attempts.},

Four classes of sounds were identified. "Whistles," which are used in social activities, occurred with the greatest frequency (c2 = 58.92, df = 3, P {\textless} 0.001). "Calls," which were very variable in form, were the second most common class used by family groups (c2 = 10.96, df = 2, 0.005 {\textgreater} P {\textgreater} 0.001). There were no differences in the rates at which schools emitted whistles and calls (c2 = 2.12, df = 1, 0.25 {\textgreater} P {\textgreater} 0.10). "Gargles" were apparently emitted by calves and were similar in structure to a low-frequency call. The fourth class, "clicks," are used in echolocation. Clicks varied considerably in their frequency of occurrence and frequency of emission, and were not always detected. There were significant differences in emission rates among the four classes (c2 = 18.73, df = 3, P {\textless} 0.001). In addition, which class of sound was emitted depended on the type of activity exhibited by the dolphins (displacement, fishing, social) and on the social structure (family or school) adopted. },

abstract = {Acoustic harassment devices (AHDs) were deployed at salmon-trap nets in the Baltic Sea to reduce gear and catch damage by grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). The AHDs emitted pulses of 250-500-ms duration, worked at a frequency of 15 kHz, and a source level of 179 dB re 1 {\{}micro{\}}Pa rms at 1 m. AHDs were deployed during three consecutive fishing seasons. Catches were significantly higher in traps with AHDs (25.5 kg d-1) than in controls (12.0 kg d-1), and catch damage was less (3.5 vs. 6.7 kg d-1). These results persisted over and between fishing seasons, but late in the season damage to the catches was common also in traps with AHDs. This study shows that the AHD may be a complementary mitigation tool in the seal-fishery conflict in certain types of fisheries, even though it is technically demanding, and for environmental reasons should be used with great care.},

abstract = {The distribution of putative dopaminergic fibers in two sensory cortical areas in the brain of the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and pilot whale (Globicephala melaena) was analyzed at the light and electron microscopic levels using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry. The quantitative analysis of the distribution of labeled fibers demonstrates that the primary visual cortex located in the lateral gyrus and entolateral sulcus contains a denser dopaminergic innervation than the auditory cortex within the posterior portion of the presylvian gyrus. In both areas, TH-immunoreactive fibers are densest in layer I, while layers IIIab and VI have intermediate densities and layers II and IIIc-V have the lowest fiber counts. Layer I is characterized by the presence of very thick TH-immunoreactive fiber populations, in addition to the thin and varicose fiber plexus observed throughout the cortical layers. Electron microscopic analyses demonstrated that some of these thick fibers represent the dendrites of TH-immunoreactive neurons located in the deep portion of layer I. The patterns observed in the present study suggest that the dopaminergic projections to the neocortex in whales have a different organization than in terrestrial mammals, particularly rodents and primates. These differences may reflect the fact that during evolution, the cetacean neocortex has retained many of the cytoarchitectonic features that are usually observed only in proisocortical regions in progressive terrestrial mammals.},

abstract = {Few attempts have been made to model the dynamics of stroke-related disability. It is possible though, using panel data and multi-state Markov regression models that incorporate measured covariates and latent variables (random effects). This study aimed to model a series of functional transitions (following a first stroke) using a three-state Markov model with or without considering random effects. Several proportional hazards parameterizations were considered. A Bayesian approach that utilizes the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Gibbs sampling functionality of WinBUGS (a Windows-based Bayesian software package) was developed to generate the marginal posterior distributions of the various transition parameters (e.g. the transition rates and transition probabilities). Model building and comparisons was guided by reference to the deviance information criteria (DIC). Of the four proportional hazards models considered, exponential regression was preferred because it led to the smallest deviances. Adding random effects further improved the model fit. Of the covariates considered, only age, infarct size, and baseline functional status were significant. By using our final model we were able to make individual predictions about functional recovery in stroke patients.},

abstract = {Bird mortality in fishing gear is a global conservation issue and it is recognised that bycatch in industrial longline and trawl fisheries threatens several seabird species. Little is known however about the effects of bycatch in small-scale gillnet fisheries on bird populations. Here we review 30 studies reporting bird bycatch in coastal gillnet fisheries in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea region in order to assess the magnitude of this problem and potential effects on bird populations. All species of diving birds that occur in the study region, including divers (loons), grebes, sea ducks, diving ducks, auks and cormorants, have been reported as dying in fishing nets. The cumulative bycatch estimate extracted from several localized studies providing such information, suggests that about 90,000 birds die in fishing nets annually, a number that is almost certainly a substantial underestimate. We conclude that it is likely that between 100,000 and 200,000 waterbirds are killed per year. Geographic and temporal patterns of bycatch generally matched species distribution and periods of presence. Also, bycatch rates varied depending on species' foraging technique and were influenced by net parameters and fishing depth. To evaluate effects of additive mortality on bird populations, we applied the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) concept to three species with the most extensive bycatch information. Agreeing with PBR assumptions we conclude that bycatch is a matter of concern for at least two of the three assessed species. We suggest that bycatch research in Europe and beyond should aim at unification of principles for bycatch assessment, setting new standards for the monitoring of waterbird populations so that vital rates and mortality data are recorded, and implementing quantifiable criteria for evaluating effects of fisheries bycatch.},

abstract = {An experiment was designed to determine if, for equal SPL and power spectrum, the effects on hearing of high-kurtosis noise exposures and a Gaussian noise exposure are different and the extent to which any differences measured in terms of audiometric and histological variables are frequency specific. Three groups of chinchillas with 10 animals/group were exposed for 5 days at 90 dB SPL to one of three types of noise, each with the same power spectrum. The impulsiveness, defined by the kurtosis, and the region of the spectrum from which the impulsive components of the noise were created differed for two of the noises, while the third was a continuous Gaussian noise. The results show that the most impulsive noise produced up to 20 dB greater permanent threshold shift at the high frequencies than did the Gaussian noise exposure. However, these audiometric results were difficult to reconcile with the pattern of sensory cell losses that showed statistically significant larger losses of outer hair cells for the impulsive exposure in the 0.25-kHz region. When the impacts in a high-kurtosis noise were created from the energy in the 1- through 6-kHz region of the spectrum, the audiometric profile of hearing loss was similar to that produced by the Gaussian noise; however, inner hair cell losses were significantly greater in the 4-kHz octave band region of the cochlea.},

abstract = {Underwater noise pollution is a growing problem in aquatic environments and as such may be a major source of stress for fish. In the present study, we addressed the effects of ship noise and continuous Gaussian noise on adrenal activity in three European freshwater species. Underwater ship noise recorded in the Danube River and two Austrian lakes was played back to fish at levels encountered in the field (153 dB re 1 [mu]Pa, 30 min). Post exposure cortisol secretion was compared with control situations. Cortisol was measured with enzyme immunoassay techniques (EIA, ng cortisol/l water/g fish) in extracted aquarium water with corrections for fish mass. In the first series, two hearing specialists, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and the gudgeon (Gobio gobio) and one hearing generalist, the European perch (Perca fluviatilis) were exposed to ship noise. The noise level was well above hearing thresholds in these species. In a second series, fish were exposed to continuous Gaussian noise at a similar level (156 dB) which is known to induce temporary hearing loss in hearing specialists. All three species responded with increased cortisol secretion when exposed to ship noise. Interestingly, no elevation was observed when fish were exposed to continuous Gaussian noise. Our results indicate that ship noise characterized by amplitude and frequency fluctuations, constitutes a potential stressor in contrast to continuous noise. Surprisingly, the data also demonstrate no apparent differences between species possessing excellent hearing abilities (hearing specialists) and species with poor hearing abilities like perch.},

abstract = {Male-female pair bonds are common to most bird species, and these bonds affect fundamental aspects of mating systems and the strength of selection, for example, by limiting extrapair paternity. Therefore, understanding factors that strengthen and erode pair bonds are important in elucidating the selection pressures that avian populations will experience. Here, we studied the effects of environmental noise on pair bonds and the strength of pair preferences ( i. e. preferences for a pair- bonded partner versus an unfamiliar individual) in the monogamous zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, a model species in studies of sexual selection. Based on a previous study, we hypothesized that high- amplitude environmental noise would decrease the strength of pair preferences. Explicitly, we tested whether females' relative preference for their pair- bonded males, compared with extrapair males, decreased as the amplitude of environmental white noise increased. Our results generally supported our hypothesis, as females' preference for their pair-bonded males significantly decreased under conditions of high environmental noise. This erosion of preference may result from the masking or distortion of the paired males' pair- bond maintaining call, although the decrease in preference could also occur because a female cannot recognize her pair- bonded male. Our findings suggest that songbird populations in areas with high environmental noise may have ( temporarily or permanently) weakened pair bonds, suggesting that extrapair behaviours could increase in areas of greater environmental noise.

High-dimensional regulation (e.g., N factors to regulate N species) has long been recognized as a possible alternative explanation, but it has not be been seriously pursued, because only a few limiting resources are evident for trees, and analysis of multiple interactions is challenging. We develop a hierarchical model that allows us to synthesize data from long-term, experimental, data sets with processes that control growth, maturation, fecundity, and survival. We allow for uncertainty at all stages and variation among 26 000 individuals and over time, including 268 000 tree years, for dozens of tree species. We estimate population-level parameters that apply at the species level and the interactions among latent states, i.e., the demographic rates for each individual, every year. The former show that the traditional trade-offs used to explain diversity are not present. Demog...},

In conditions of no rain and low wind (Sea State 0-2) the alarms were presumed to be clearly audible to harbour porpoises at ranges of 0.1-0.6 km. Catch rates of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), and pollock (Pollachius virens) were not significantly different in alarmed and nonalarmed nets (except in one season when pollock were caught in lower numbers in alarmed nets).

Over a 290-base pair fragment, 23 variable sites defined 33 unique haplotypes among the total of 87 samples. Nucleotide diversity at the control region was relatively low (pi = 1.27{\%}+/- 0.723{\%}) compared to wide-ranging baleen whales, but higher than strongly matrifocal sperm, pilot and killer whales. Phylogenetic reconstruction using maximum likelihood revealed four distinct haplotype groups, each of which displayed strong frequency differences among ocean basins, but no reciprocal monophyly or fixed character differences. Consistent with this phylogeographic pattern, an analysis of molecular variance showed high levels of differentiation among ocean basins (F(ST) = 0.14, Phi ST = 0.42; P {\textless} 0.001). Estimated rates of female migration among ocean basins were low (generally {\textless} or = 2 individuals per generation). Regional sample sizes were too small to detect subdivisions within oceans except in the North Atlantic, where the Mediterranean Sea (n = 12) was highly differentiated due to the presence of two private haplotypes. One market product purchased in South Korea grouped with other haplotypes found only in the North Atlantic, suggesting a violation of current agreements banning international trade in cetacean species. Together, these results demonstrate a high degree of isolation and low maternal gene flow among oceanic, and in some cases, regional populations of Cuvier's beaked whales. This has important implications for understanding the threats of human impact, including fisheries by-catch, direct hunting, and disturbance or mortality from anthropogenic sound.},

abstract = {A within-subject comparison of auditory steady-state response (ASSR) and psychophysical measurements of aerial hearing sensitivity was conducted with an individual of the largest otariid species, the Steller sea lion. Psychophysical methods were used to obtain an unmasked aerial audiogram at 13 frequencies, spanning a range of 0.125-34 kHz. The subject had a hearing range (frequencies audible at 60 dB(rms) re 20 microPa) of about 0.250-30 kHz, and a region of best hearing sensitivity from 5-14.1 kHz. The psychophysical aerial audiogram of this Steller sea lion was remarkably similar to aerial audiograms previously obtained for California sea lions and northern fur seals, suggesting that the otariid pinnipeds form a functional hearing group. ASSR thresholds, measured at frequencies of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 32 kHz, were elevated relative to corresponding psychophysical thresholds, ranging from +1 dB at 20 kHz, to +31 dB at 1 kHz. The ASSR audiogram accurately predicted the subject's high-frequency cutoff, and provided a reasonable estimate of hearing sensitivity at frequencies above 2 kHz. In testing situations where psychophysical methods are not possible, ASSR methods may provide an objective and efficient estimate of behavioral hearing sensitivity in otariid pinnipeds.},

abstract = {Toothed whales use intense ultrasonic clicks to echolocate prey and it has been hypothesized that they also acoustically debilitate their prey with these intense sound pulses to facilitate capture. Cephalopods are an important food source for toothed whales, and there has probably been an evolutionary selection pressure on cephalopods to develop a mechanism for detecting and evading sound-emitting toothed whale predators. Ultrasonic detection has evolved in some insects to avoid echolocating bats, and it can be hypothesized that cephalopods might have evolved similar ultrasound detection as an anti-predation measure. We test this hypothesis in the squid Loligo pealeii in a playback experiment using intense echolocation clicks from two squid-eating toothed whale species. Twelve squid were exposed to clicks at two repetition rates (16 and 125 clicks per second) with received sound pressure levels of 199-226 dB re1 microPa (pp) mimicking the sound exposure from an echolocating toothed whale as it approaches and captures prey. We demonstrate that intense ultrasonic clicks do not elicit any detectable anti-predator behaviour in L. pealeii and that clicks with received levels up to 226 dB re1 microPa (pp) do not acoustically debilitate this cephalopod species.},

In shipboard line-transect surveys binocular reticles are used to obtain estimates of radial distance from the ship to animals. From shore-based platforms both binocular reticles and theodolites are used to measure distances for determining spatial distributions and dive patterns of coastal animals. In aerial line-transect surveys inclinometers or angle markings on observation windows or wing struts are used to determine perpendicular distances from sightings to the trackline. In this note we present formulae which take into account the curvature of the earth for converting the angular readings from these instruments to the desired distance values. These formulae are then compared with approximations that have been used in the analysis of marine mammal survey data. The extent to which these approximations diverge from the distance formulae presented here is identified. The presented formulae have been used by researchers in marine mammal science in the past. The purpose of this note is to present them in the context of marine mammal surveys from various platforms. },

Recordings were acquired from a number of locations and encounters. Significant differences were found between species and, to a lesser extent, between locations. The calls of the two pilot whale species are distinct despite their close relatedness, and similar size and morphology. This may be due to selection pressures to maintain distinctiveness. The variance was partitioned into between-species, between-location (within species) and within-location factors. For the frequency variables, variation between-species is high relative to variation between locations. Thus geographic variation is a relatively minor effect, compared to the many processes which cause interspecific differences. The within-location component includes such factors as social context, behaviour and group composition. This component is of a similar magnitude to the between-species component, indicating that whistles vary considerably with these factors. Significant between-location differences may be attributable to these confounding factors. For whistle duration, most of the variation occurred within location. There is less significant variation in duration across species compared with the frequency measures. This study highlights the need to collect samples across all potential strata whenever possible, and provides a framework for future, more comprehensive work.

abstract = {A bottlenosed dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) was trained to mimic computer-generated "model" sounds, using a whistle mode of vocalization. Prior to training, the whistle sounds of this dolphin were limited to a few stereotyped forms, none of which resembled the model sounds. After training, high-fidelity imitations were obtained of model sounds having (a) moderately or widely swept, slow-rate frequency modulation (1-2 Hz), (b) narrowly or moderately swept frequency modulation at moderate to rapid rates (3-11 Hz), (c) square-wave frequency transitions, and (d) unmodulated (pure-tone) waveforms. New models, not heard previously, could be mimicked immediately, often with good fidelity, including mimicry of amplitude variation that had not been explicitly reinforced during training. Subsets of familiar models were mimicked with high reliability in repeated tests. In additional training, control of the mimic response was transferred from the acoustic model to objects shown the dolphin (e.g., a ball or a hoop) so that, in effect, the dolphin gave unique vocal labels to those objects. In a test of accuracy and reliability of labeling, correct vocal labels were given on 91{\%} of 167 trials comprised of five different objects presented in random order. The dolphin's ability for vocal mimicry compared favorably with that of the more versatile mimic birds, and it contrasted sharply with the apparent lack of vocal mimicry ability in terrestrial mammals other than humans. The ability to label objects vocally was similar to abilities shown for some birds and similar, in principle, to abilities of great apes trained in visual languages to label objects through gestures or other visual symbols.},

abstract = {The pelagic life history phase of reef fishes and decapod crustaceans is complex, and the evolutionary drivers and ecological consequences of this life history strategy remain largely speculative. There is no doubt, however, that this life history phase is very significant in the demographics of reef populations. Here, we initially discuss the ecology and evolution of the pelagic life histories as a context to our review of the role of acoustics in the latter part of the pelagic phase as the larvae transit back onto a reef. Evidence is reviewed showing that larvae are actively involved in this transition. They are capable swimmers and can locate reefs from hundreds of metres if not kilometres away. Evidence also shows that sound is available as an orientation cue, and that fishes and crustaceans hear sound and orient to sound in a manner that is consistent with their use of sound to guide settlement onto reefs. Comparing particle motion sound strengths in the field (8 × 10-11 m at 5 km from a reef) with the measured behavioural and electrophysiological threshold of fishes of (3 × 10-11 m and 10 × 10-11, respectively) provides evidence that sound may be a useful orientation cue at a range of kilometres rather than hundreds of metres. These threshold levels are for adult fishes and we conclude that better data are needed for larval fishes and crustaceans at the time of settlement. Measurements of field strengths in the region of reefs and threshold levels are suitable for showing that sound could be used; however, field experiments are the only effective tool to demonstrate the actual use of underwater sound for orientation purposes. A diverse series of field experiments including light[hyphen (true graphic)]trap catches enhanced by replayed reef sound, in situ observations of behaviour and sound[hyphen (true graphic)]enhanced settlement rate on patch reefs collectively provide a compelling case that sound is used as an orientation and settlement cue for these late larval stages.},

abstract = {Concern regarding the spread of silver carp (Hypopthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Aristichthysc nobilis) through the Illinois River has prompted the development of an Acoustic Fish Deterrent (AFD) system. The application of this technology has resulted in a need to understand the auditory physiology of fish other than the target species, in order to minimise the effect of the AFD barrier on the ecology of indigenous fish populations. To this end, both the structures involved in sound reception and the hearing abilities of the paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) and the lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) are studied here using a combination of morphological and physiological approaches, revealing that both fish are responsive to sounds ranging in frequency from 100 to 500 Hz. The lowest hearing thresholds from both species were acquired from frequencies in a bandwidth of between 200 and 300 Hz, with higher thresholds at 100 and 500 Hz. The rationale for studying hearing in P. spathula and A. fulvescens in particular, is the value placed on them by both the commercial caviar producing industry and by the recreational fisheries sector. The hearing abilities of twelve P. spathula and twelve A. fulvescens were tested in sound fields dominated by either sound pressure or particle motion, with the results showing that acipenseriform fish are responsive to the motion of water particles in a sound field, rather than the sound pressure component. In this study, we measure the intensity of the sound field required to evoke threshold responses using a pressure sensitive hydrophone, as pressure dominated sound fields are the most audible acoustic condition for specialists like H. molitrix and A. nobilis (the target species). The results of the auditory examination clearly show that P. spathula and A. fulvescens are not sensitive to sound pressure, and will therefore have a significantly higher deterrent threshold than H. molitrix and A. nobilis in a pressure dominated sound field.},

Many of these groups have a definite structure: a central Nuclear Animal, with or without a calf, is surrounded by escorts who compete, sometimes violently, for proximity to the Nuclear Animal. This competition involves fluke thrashes, the blowing of bubblestreams, and physical contact, some of which appears designed to hurt an opponent: bleeding wounds are seen on the competing escorts. Escorts sometimes leave these groups and start singing, and singers sometimes stop to join large groups. The pattern of interactions strongly suggests that the escorts are males competing for access to a central female. Off Hawaii singers respond to such groups at ranges of up to approximately 7.5 km. On Silver Bank, Principal Escorts maintained a position of closest proximity to the Nuclear Animal for an average of 7.5 hours before replacement.},

abstract = {Abstract: We analysed whether South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens) varied the syntax or arrangement of vocalizations (the order in which calls were produced) according to different social contexts. Three male calls that formed a progression of increasingly aggressive displays (growl{\textless}bark{\textless}highpitched call) were studied in a breeding colony at Pen{\'{i}}nsula Vald{\'{e}}s. We found that: (a) growls and barks had higher probabilities of emission than high-pitched calls, (b) vocal bouts generally were initiated by growls, (c) the transitions most likely to occur were growl-bark and bark-growl, and (d) the number of male-male agonistic interactions (highpitched call after growl, bark after growl) and the number of neighbour males (growl after highpitched call) affected some transitions between call types. The baseline vocal display of males consists of a sequence of growls and barks given in succession (e.g., growl-bark-growl-bark), which can incorporate high-pitched calls during highly aggressive male-male interactions. Vocal arrangement variations could be a strategy to modulate agonistic behaviour during vocal displays and to increase the chances of being detected in noisy breeding colonies.},

abstract = {Tree shrews are small mammals living in the tropical forest of Southeast Asia. The habitus of species within the genus Tupaia is often quite similar, so that it is difficult to differentiate the species based on their morphology. We applied comparative bioacoustics, a tool successfully used to discriminate cryptic species of nocturnal mammals, to investigate whether species in the diurnal genus Tupaia can be recognized noninvasively on the basis of a conspicuous loud call, the chatter. We studied to what extent the chatter call of 2 tree shrew species, Tupaia glis and T. belangeri, differed in acoustic structure. We also acoustically analyzed the chatter call of T. chinensis, a subspecies or closely related parapatric species of T. belangeri. Analyzed acoustic features allowed assigning chatter calls with a probability of more than 73{\%} to the species that produced them. Bioacoustical differences are in line with subtle morphological differences, supporting species status for all 3 studied tree shrew species and corroborating immunodiffusion and genetic data that differentiate T. glis and T. belangeri. Loud calls may offer a reliable noninvasive tool for species diagnosis and discrimination in cryptic species of this diurnal mammalian group.},

Drivers of change include shifts in climate, acoustic pollution, disturbances to trophic structure, fisheries interactions, harmful algal blooms, and environmental contaminants. This Special Feature provides an in-depth examination of 3 issues that are particularly troublesome. The 1st article notes the huge spatial and temporal scales of change to which marine mammals are showing ecological responses, and how these species can function as sentinels of such change.

abstract = {Abstract: Bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) produce simultaneous loud, long, narrowband underwater trills. It is likely that calls separated by 1/3 octave will not mask each other. Three call (trill) types were identified. Pitch separations between nearest-neighbour calls were measured by sampling at 1-s intervals. Calls spanned 5 octaves and were centred near 1 kHz. Mean pitch separations decreased significantly as the number of simultaneous calls increased from 2 to 9–11, but remained relatively constant at about 0.3 octave at higher numbers of simultaneous calls. For 2–12 simultaneous calls, the pitch separations between 0.0 and 0.4 octave were fewer than random. Proportions of the three trill types did not change as the numbers of simultaneous calls increased. All three call types had fewer pitch separations below 1/3 octave than between 1/3 and 2/3 octave. No relationship was found between pitch separation and call duration. Differences in starting pitch and the regular decline in pitch throughout most calls ensured that mean pitch separations of {\textgreater}1/3 octave were maintained even when many calls occurred simultaneously. Bearded seals may use pitch separation as a jamming-avoidance mechanism.},

abstract = {A long-baseline (LBL) acoustic system has been developed for the tracking of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) that have been tagged with digital acoustic recording devices (DTAGs), providing quantitative observations of submerged whale behavior during bubble net feeding. The system includes three high-frequency acoustic sources deployed from small boats that follow the whale after the animal has been tagged. Integrated global positioning systems (GPSs) provide positioning and synchronized operation of the sources. Time-encoded acoustic signals from the sources are recorded along with whale vocalizations and ambient noise on the whale tag. Time-of-flight measurements, as measured by the tag acoustic data, are converted to range from the whale to each source with a measured sound-speed profile. A nonlinear least squares solution is then solved for the whale's position with a nominal positional fix rate of once per second. The system is demonstrated with data collected from a tagged animal in summer 2007. Dead-reckoned track generation methods commonly used in previous studies are shown to capture the qualitative nature of the whale track, albeit with poor absolute positional accuracy, and to distort the track when the whale's movement is predominantly vertical. In contrast, the LBL data can provide quantitative measures of whale behavior. Transit speeds between bubble net feeding events for this case study are found to range from 0.7 to 1.9 m {\textperiodcentered} s-1 (n = 8). The mean diameter of bubble net curtains are measured to range from 9.6 to 10.9 m. Whale speeds during bubble net rotations vary from 1.0 to 1.9 m {\textperiodcentered} s-1 (n = 6).},

The two loggers were successfully recovered and a total of 141 h of diving data (depth and water temperature in 4,671 dives) was obtained. Both porpoises dived almost continuously, rarely exhibiting long-term rest at the surface. Maximum dive depths were 98.6 m and 70.8 m, respectively, with more than 70{\%} of diving time at 20 m or less. Most shallow dives were V-shaped with no bottom time. The V-shaped dives were significantly shallower in dive depth and shorter in dive duration than U-shaped dives. Descent rate was not constant during a dive. The deeper the dive depths, the faster the mean descent and initial descent rates. This suggests that porpoises have anticipated the depth to which they will dive before initiating the dive itself.},

abstract = {Three Pipistrellus pygmaeus bats were trained to capture prey on the wing while flying in the laboratory. The bats' capture behaviour and capture success were determined and correlated with acoustic analyses of post-buzz echolocation signals. Three acoustic parameters revealed capture success: in case of success, post-buzz pauses (pbP) were longer, interpulse intervals (IPI) of the post-buzz signals were longer and, most notably, the spectra of the echolocation signals showed a number of notches that were absent after unsuccessful attempts. If the bats touched the prey without seizing it, pbP was significantly increased, but by less than was seen following a successful capture. Thus, acoustic recordings can be used to determine the outcome of capture 72-75{\%} correct using IPI or pbP, and with 78{\%} correct using notches. Even more trials ({\textgreater}85{\%}) were classified correctly by using the first canonical discriminant factor from principal component analysis combining the three parameters. Four types of prey were used, of 7-22 mm length and 7-240 mg mass. After successful captures, interpulse intervals, post-buzz pause and notches all depended on prey type, but not in a way that was systematically related to size, indicating that acoustic parameters cannot reveal prey size.},

During 15 months of research, 79 d (65.3{\%} of the total monitored days) were spent in direct observation of 146 groups of bottlenose dolphins around the fish farm cages. There was a peak in bottlenose dolphin presence during winter. Photographs were taken in the fish farm area during 79 encounters on 61 different days (totalling 34 marked individuals). The regular occurrence of some dolphins suggests individual preferences for the fish farm area. The incidental bottlenose dolphin capture observed in large, loose predator nets (1 dolphin per month) is cause for concern, as it is questionable whether or not the bottlenose dolphins in the area can sustain incidental capture of this magnitude. The information gained from this study shows the necessity for further regulations to be established, both in the use of predator nets and management of marine fish farms.},

Ecol. Complexity 4, 73-84. doi:10.1016/j.ecocom.2007.03.002.] suggest that factors other than climate warming are responsible for a decline in the polar bear population of Western Hudson Bay. They propose: (1) that there is no evidence that the climate has warmed significantly in western Hudson Bay, (2) that any negative effects on the polar bear population likely result from interactions with humans (such as research activities, management actions, or tourism), (3) that studies suggesting climate war-Ming could influence polar bear populations are confounded by natural fluctuations and (4) that polar bears will adapt to climate warming by eating vegetation, hunting other marine mammal species, and evolving new physiological mechanisms. in our examination of their alternative explanations, and the data available to evaluate each, we found little support for any. Research conducted since 1997 (when the last data were collected for the analyses in Stirling et al., 1999 [Stirling, L, Lunn, N.J., lacozza, J., 1999, Long-term trends in the population ecology of polar bears in western Hudson Bay in relation to climate change. Arctic S2, 294-306.]) continues to be consistent with the thesis that climate warming in western Hudson Bay is the major factor causing the sea ice to breakup at progressively earlier dates, resulting in polar bears coming ashore to fast for several months in progressively poorer condition, resulting in negative affects on survival of young, subadult, and older (but not prime) adults and reproduction. When the population began to decline, the hunting quota for Inuit in Nunavut was no longer sustainable, which in turn probably resulted in the decline accelerating over time as a result of overharvesting (Regehr et al., 2007 [Regehr, E.V., Lunn, N.J., Amstrup, S.C., Stirling, L, 2007.

abstract = {R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} / Abstract Male humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) emit an ever-changing series of sounds during the breeding season known as song. The purpose of this study was to describe the behaviour and interactions of singers and, within this context, hypothesize song function. A sample of 167 singer interactions was collected from 1997-2002 offMaui, Hawaii. Singers typically: (1) were lone adults (80{\%}); (2) sang until joined by non-singing males (89{\%}), at least some of which had been neighbouring singers; (3) engaged in brief interactions (80{\%} {\textless}10 minutes); otherwise the pair stayed together until a subsequent interaction; (4) were involved in non-agonistic interactions (80{\%}); and (5) were involved in series of such interactions across the breeding ground (documented in 25{\%} of sample) which could lead to one or more of the interacting males joining a group that included a female (documented in 13{\%} of sample). A singer-joiner interaction proceeded directly to apparent cooperative behaviour around a female in two cases; this relationship was not ruled out in similar interactions. The two key elements of male behaviour during the breeding season are a song that unites males, but changes collectively and a wide range of male relationships that range from agonistic, to non-agonistic, to cooperative. We hypothesize that the song organizes males by providing, through its characteristics of continuous change and adoption of these changes by all nearby singers, a real time measure of association between individuals, possibly providing a means of reciprocity for mutual assistance in mating. },

Occasionally, offshore species such as the fin whale Balaenoptera physalus, the white-sided dolphin L. acutus and the sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus are also found stranded. In order to trace their diet, we measured delta(13)C and delta(15)N in their muscles as well as in 49 invertebrate and fish species collected from the southern North Sea. The delta(15)N data indicate that the harbour seal, grey seal and white-beaked dolphin occupy the highest trophic position, along with ichtyophageous fishes such as the cod Gadus morhua (mean muscle values of 18.7, 17.9, 18.8 and 19.2parts per thousand respectively). The harbour porpoise occupies a slightly lower trophic position (mean delta(15)N value of 16.2parts per thousand), reflecting a higher amount of zooplanktivorous fishes in its diet (mean delta(15)N of 14.7parts per thousand); 2 suckling harbour porpoises displayed a significant delta(15)N enrichment of 2.2parts per thousand compared to adult females. Adult females are delta(15)N-enriched compared to adult male harbour porpoises. Fin whales, sperm whales and white-sided dolphins are C-13-depleted compared to southern North Sea particulate organic matter and species, suggesting that despite regular sightings, they do not feed within the southern North Sea area.},

At the most sensitive frequencies the mean thresholds varied between -18 and -26 dB/µbar (Fig. 4).2.Variation in the thresholds at most frequencies was related to changes in the level of ambient sea noise (Figs. 5–7). Only in calm sea conditions were unmasked thresholds obtained. The masking effect of noise was confirmed by raising the level artificially. The thresholds increased in proportion to the increase in noise level.3.The thresholds were largely independent of the distance of the sound source over the range from 1.7 to 50m, suggesting that cod are sensitive to acoustic pressure. However, a changeover to particle displacement sensitivity was noted at frequencies below 50 Hz when the sound source was moved to within l m of the fish (Fig. 9).4.It is concluded that the swimbladder plays an accessory role in hearing. Differences obtained in the thresholds at different sound source distances may be explained in terms of the displacement sensitivity of the otolith organs. These respond to displacements re-radiated from the swimbladder in the far-field, and to the greater incident displacement in the near-field at very low frequencies.},

Little is known about the factors that determine how whales learn from their auditory experiences. Song learning in birds is better understood and appears to be constrained by stable core attributes such as species-specific sound repertoires and song syntax. To clarify whether similar constraints exist for song learning by humpbacks, we analyzed changes over 14 years in the sounds used by humpback whales singing in Hawaiian waters. We found that although the properties of individual sounds within songs are quite variable over time, the overall distribution of certain acoustic features within the repertoire appears to be stable. In particular, our findings suggest that species-specific constraints on temporal features of song sounds determine song form, whereas spectral variability allows whales to flexibly adapt song elements.},

abstract = {Observations undertaken during 201 seismic surveys in UK and adjacent waters were analysed to examine effects on cetaceans. Sighting rates, distance from the airguns and orientation were compared for periods when airguns were active and when they were silent, both for surveys with airgun arrays of large volume and surveys with smaller volume arrays. The results demonstrate that cetaceans can be disturbed by seismic exploration. Small odontocetes showed the strongest lateral spatial avoidance (extending at least as far as the limit of visual observation) in response to active airguns, while mysticetes and killer whales showed more localised spatial avoidance. Long-finned pilot whales showed only a change in orientation and sperm whales showed no statistically significant effects. Responses to active airguns were greater during those seismic surveys with large volume airgun arrays than those with smaller volumes of airguns. It is suggested that the different taxonomic groups of cetaceans may adopt different strategies for responding to acoustic disturbance from seismic surveys; some small odontocetes move out of the immediate area, while the slower moving mysticetes orient away from the vessel and increase their distance from the source but do not move away from the area completely.},

abstract = {The sperm whale carries a hypertrophied nose that generates powerful clicks for long-range echolocation. However, it remains a conundrum how this bizarrely shaped apex predator catches its prey. Several hypotheses have been advanced to propose both active and passive means to acquire prey, including acoustic debilitation of prey with very powerful clicks. Here we test these hypotheses by using sound and movement recording tags in a fine-scale study of buzz sequences to relate the acoustic behaviour of sperm whales with changes in acceleration in their head region during prey capture attempts. We show that in the terminal buzz phase, sperm whales reduce inter-click intervals and estimated source levels by 1-2 orders of magnitude. As a result, received levels at the prey are more than an order of magnitude below levels required for debilitation, precluding acoustic stunning to facilitate prey capture. Rather, buzzing involves high-frequency, low amplitude clicks well suited to provide high-resolution biosonar updates during the last stages of capture. The high temporal resolution helps to guide motor patterns during occasionally prolonged chases in which prey are eventually subdued with the aid of fast jaw movements and/or buccal suction as indicated by acceleration transients (jerks) near the end of buzzes.},

Spastic contraction of terminal bronchiolar muscular sphincters was also observed. The changes are consistent with multi-systemic injury caused by massive release of endogenous catecholamines or vasospasm leading to ischemic injury, followed by reperfusion and reperfusion injury. The histopathological findings suggest that the reflex response of an odontocete to any major perceived threat (the "alarm reaction") is to activate the physiological adaptations to diving or escape to an extreme or pathological level, resulting, if greatly prolonged, in widespread ischemic injury to tissues. These observations may explain why these species die abruptly from handling or transportation and why the mortality of highly stressed beach-stranded animals is very high. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This sensory plasticity provides an adaptable mechanism that enhances coupling between sender and receiver in vocal communication.},

abstract = {Variation in vocal signals among populations and social groups of animals provides opportunities for the study of the mechanisms of behavioural change and their importance in generating and maintaining behavioural variation. We analysed two call types made by two matrilineal social groups of resident killer whales, Orcinus orca, over 12-13 years. We used a neural network-based index of acoustic similarity to identify mechanisms of call differentiation. A test for structural modification of the calls detected significant changes in one call type in both groups, but not in the other. For the modified call type, the rate of divergence between the two groups was significantly lower than the rate of modification within either group showing that calls were modified in a similar fashion in the two groups. An analysis of structural parameters detected no strong directionality in the change. The pattern of call modification could have been caused by maturational changes to the calls or, if killer whale dialects are learned behavioural traits, cultural drift in the structure of the calls together with horizontal transmission of modifications between the two groups. Such vocal matching between members of different matrilines would suggest that vocal learning is not limited to vertical transmission from mother to offspring, which has important implications for models of gene-culture coevolution.},

Not all behavioral changes have fitness consequences, and our goal is to derive metrics that can be linked to fitness implications, such as time and energy allocation to different functional behaviors. Here we detail an approach that incorporates biological knowledge and multiple streams of tag-recorded data in a hidden state-switching model to estimate time series of functional behavioral st ates for 12 sperm whales off Norway. Foraging, recovery and resting states were specified in the hidden state model by state-dependent likelihood structures.

abstract = {Harbour porpoises in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine feed primarily on Atlantic herring. Herring stocks have undergone dramatic fluctuations in abundance over the past three decades due to changes in fishing intensity. In order to understand the effects of these changes in prey abundance on the patterns of maternal investment, I examined interdecadal variation in the size of porpoise calves measured in August prior to weaning. Female harbour porpoises exhibited significant variation in maternal investment between 1970 and 1999. During the 1980s, females consumed more herring and produced larger calves. Surprisingly, however, this increased maternal investment occurred during the period of lowest prey abundance, perhaps because the herring stock assessment does not reflect the availability or quality of prey to female porpoises.},

abstract = {The elicitation of scientific and technical judgments from experts, in the form of subjective probability distributions, can be a valuable addition to other forms of evidence in support of public policy decision making. This paper explores when it is sensible to perform such elicitation and how that can best be done. A number of key issues are discussed, including topics on which there are, and are not, experts who have knowledge that provides a basis for making informed predictive judgments; the inadequacy of only using qualitative uncertainty language; the role of cognitive heuristics and of overconfidence; the choice of experts; the development, refinement, and iterative testing of elicitation protocols that are designed to help experts to consider systematically all relevant knowledge when they make their judgments; the treatment of uncertainty about model functional form; diversity of expert opinion; and when it does or does not make sense to combine judgments from different experts. Although it may be tempting to view expert elicitation as a low-cost, low-effort alternative to conducting serious research and analysis, it is neither. Rather, expert elicitation should build on and use the best available research and analysis and be undertaken only when, given those, the state of knowledge will remain insufficient to support timely informed assessment and decision making.},

abstract = {The structure and context of alarm calls produced by chipmunks (Tamias striatus) at a field site in southern Quebec were recorded during opportunistic field observations and experimentally simulated hawk attacks. Chipmunks produced three call types in the presence of predators. Chipping consisted of a series of high frequency notes with a rapid downward frequency slope (9.6 to 2.8 kHz) and was given in the presence of mammalian predators by chipmunks perched on a raised vantage point. Chucking consisted of a series of lower frequency notes also sloping downwards (2.5 to 0.4 kHz), given in the presence of avian predators by perched animals. The trill was a lower amplitude, multi-note call usually given only once by animals before reaching a refuge while fleeing from either type of predator. The average trill contained 6-11 downward sloping notes (7.3 to 0.8 kHz). The alarm call types of eastern chipmunks appear to be similar to those reported for western chipmunks. However, they differ in the clear separation of the calls for aerial and terrestrial predators. Chipmunks differ from most other terrestrial sciurids in giving repeated calls' for aerial as well as terrestrial predators and in using a call just before reaching a secure refuge.},

abstract = {The unmasked underwater hearing sensitivities of an 8-year-old male and a 7-year-old female Steller sea lion were measured in a pool, by using behavioral psychophysics, The animals were trained with positive reinforcement to respond when they detected an acoustic signal and not to respond when they did not. The signals were narrow-band, frequency-modulated stimuli with a duration of 600 ms and center frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 32 kHz for the male and from 4 to 32 kHz for the female. Detection thresholds at each frequency were measured by varying signal amplitude according to the up-down staircase method. The resulting underwater audiogram (50{\%} detection thresholds) for the male Steller sea lion showed the typical mammalian U-shape, His maximum sensitivity (77 dB re: 1 mu Pa, rms) occurred at I kHz. The range of best hearing (10 dB from the maximum sensitivity) was from I to 16 kHz (4 octaves). Higher hearing thresholds (indicating poorer sensitivity) were observed below I kHz and above 16 kHz. The maximum sensitivity of the female (73 dB re: 1 mu Pa, rms) occurred at 25 kHz. Higher hearing thresholds (indicating poorer sensitivity) were observed for signals below 16 kHz and above 25 kHz. At frequencies for which both subjects were tested, hearing thresholds of the male were significantly higher than those of the female. The hearing sensitivity differences between the male and female Steller sea lion in this study may be due to individual differences in sensitivity between the subjects or due to sexual dimorphism in hearing.

This process entails a high energetic cost that effectively decreases dive duration and increases post-dive recovery time. To examine the body mechanics of fin whales during foraging dives we attached high-resolution digital tags, equipped with a hydrophone, a depth gauge and a dual-axis accelerometer, to the backs of surfacing fin whales in the Southern California Bight. Body pitch and roll were estimated by changes in static gravitational acceleration detected by orthogonal axes of the accelerometer, while higher frequency, smaller amplitude oscillations in the accelerometer signals were interpreted as bouts of active fluking. Instantaneous velocity of the whale was determined from the magnitude of turbulent flow noise measured by the hydrophone and confirmed by kinematic analysis. Fin whales employed gliding gaits during descent, executed a series of lunges at depth and ascended to the surface by steady fluking. Our examination of body kinematics at depth reveals variable lunge-feeding behavior in the context of distinct kinematic modes, which exhibit temporal coordination of rotational torques with translational accelerations. Maximum swimming speeds during lunges match previous estimates of the flow-induced pressure needed to completely expand the buccal cavity during feeding.},

Curiously, vocal recognition seems absent or limited in some highly social species such as the black-legged kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla. Using playback experiments, we found that kittiwake chicks recognized their parents vocally, this capacity being detectable as early as 20 days after hatching, the youngest age tested. Mates also recognized each other's long calls. Some birds reacted to their partner's voice when only a part of the long call was played back. Nevertheless, only about a third of the tested birds reacted to their mate's or parents' call and we were unable to detect recognition among neighbours. We discuss the low reactivity of kittiwakes in relation to their cliff-nesting habit and compare our results with evidence of vocal recognition in other larids.},

abstract = {Offshore wind farming is a new emerging technology in the field of renewable energies. This study investigates the potential impact of the construction of one of the first major, offshore wind farms ({\textgreater} 100 MW) on harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena by means of acoustic porpoise detectors (T-PODs) monitoring porpoise echolocation activity. The monitoring program was established as a modified BACI (before, after, control, impact) design, with 6 monitoring stations equally distributed between the impact area and a nearby reference area. Mean waiting times, defined as the period between 2 consecutive encounters of echolocation activity, increased from 6 h in the baseline period to 3 d in the wind farm area during the construction. This increase was 6 times larger than changes observed in the reference area. One specific construction activity, involving the ramming and vibration of steel sheet piles into the seabed, was associated with an additional significant increase in waiting time of 4 to 41 h, in both the construction and reference areas. Assuming that echolocation activity is related to harbour porpoise density, the analysis shows that their habitat-use changed substantially, with the porpoises leaving the construction area of the offshore wind farm. Acoustic monitoring from fixed positions provides data with a high temporal resolution, but low spatial resolution, which can be analysed at a variety of scales, and can be applied to harbour porpoises and other echolocating cetaceans.},

abstract = {Throughout evolution the foraging and echolocation behaviors as well as the motor systems of bats have been adapted to the tasks they have to perform while searching and acquiring food. When bats exploit the same class of environmental resources in a similar way, they perform comparable tasks and thus share similar adaptations independent of their phylogeny. Species with similar adaptations are assigned to guilds or functional groups. Habitat type and foraging mode mainly determine the foraging tasks and thus the adaptations of bats. Therefore, we use habitat type and foraging mode to define seven guilds. The habitat types open, edge and narrow space are defined according to the bats' echolocation behavior in relation to the distance between bat and background or food item and background. Bats foraging in the aerial, trawling, flutter detecting, or active gleaning mode use only echolocation to acquire their food. When foraging in the passive gleaning mode bats do not use echolocation but rely on sensory cues from the food item to find it. Bat communities often comprise large numbers of species with a high diversity in foraging areas, foraging modes, and diets. The assignment of species living under similar constraints into guilds identifies patterns of community structure and helps to understand the factors that underlie the organization of highly diverse bat communities. Bat species from different guilds do not compete for food as they differ in their foraging behavior and in the environmental resources they use. However, sympatric living species belonging to the same guild often exploit the same class of resources. To avoid competition they should differ in their niche dimensions. The fine grain structure of bat communities below the rather coarse classification into guilds is determined by mechanisms that result in niche partitioning.},

abstract = {The off-axis sonar beam patterns of eight free-ranging finless porpoises were measured using attached data logger systems. The transmitted sound pressure level at each beam angle was calculated from the animal's body angle, the water surface echo level, and the swimming depth. The beam pattern of the off-axis signals between 45 and 115 (where 0 corresponds to the on-axis direction) was nearly constant. The sound pressure level of the off-axis signals reached 162 dB re 1 mPa peak-to-peak. The surface echo level received at the animal was over 140 dB, much higher than the auditory threshold level of small odontocetes. Finless porpoises are estimated to be able to receive the surface echoes of off-axis signals even at 50-m depth. Shallow water systems (less than 50-m depth) are the dominant habitat of both oceanic and freshwater populations of this species. Surface echoes may provide porpoises not only with diving depth information but also with information about surface direction and location of obstacles (including prey items) outside the on-axis sector of the sonar beam. 2005 Acoustical Society of America.},

Here, we used controlled exposure experiments with simulated military sonar and other mid-frequency sounds to measure behavioural responses of tagged blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) in feeding areas within the Southern California Bight. Despite using source levels orders of magnitude below some operational military systems, our results demonstrate that mid-frequency sound can significantly affect blue whale behaviour, especially during deep feeding modes. When a response occurred, behavioural changes varied widely from cessation of deep feeding to increased swimming speed and directed travel away from the sound source. The variability of these behavioural responses was largely influenced by a complex interaction of behavioural state, the type of mid-frequency sound and received sound level. Sonar-induced disruption of feeding and displacement from high-quality prey patches could have significant and previously undocumented impacts on baleen whale foraging ecology, individual fitness and population health.},

The resident-type killer whales of Avacha Gulf formed temporally stable units that included maternal relatives with no dispersal observed. Acoustically, the killer whale community of Avacha Gulf was characterized by a system of dialects comparable to the communities of Northeast Pacific resident-type killer whales. Different units rarely associated with each other and these associations were nonrandom. Associations at different spatial levels did not always coincide with each other and with the patterns of acoustic similarity. Associations between units could change quickly irrespective of kinship relationships. The vocal dialect of a unit, which is more stable than the association patterns between units, might better reflect the overall kinship relationships. The stability and frequency of associations between units depended on the number of mature males in a unit, which could contribute to differences in the speed of change in vocal dialects and association patterns.},

abstract = {Bottlenose dolphins possess a sophisticated echolocation system, but evidence suggests that they use this sensory modality sparingly in the wild. Several authors have noted that soniferous fish are prevalent in the diet of bottlenose dolphins, leading to the hypothesis that these predators detect their prey by passive listening. We tested this hypothesis by performing controlled acoustic playback experiments with free-ranging dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida. We used recorded calls of prey fish and sounds of snapping shrimp as experimental and control treatments, respectively, and measured the dolphins' direction of travel and rate of echolocation as response variables. Dolphins changed their direction of travel significantly, turning towards the sound source when fish sounds were played. In addition, dolphins significantly increased their rate of echolocation immediately following playbacks of fish sounds. The sounds of snapping shrimp elicited neither directional nor echolocation responses. The occurrence of echolocation sounds was low, except following playback of fish sounds. We conclude that bottlenose dolphins use passive listening extensively during the search phase of the foraging process. By listening passively, dolphins may obtain useful information on the identity number, size and location of soniferous prey. Once dolphins discover prey by passive means, they then appear to use echolocation to track the prey during the pursuit and capture phases. Such judicious use of echolocation suggests that this sensory modality incurs significant energetic or ecological costs. These findings have implications for coevolution of dolphins and their prey with regard to sound production and detection. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

A broadband linear frequency-modulated signal and a short dolphinlike sonar signal were used as the incident signals. The fish were anesthetized and attached to a monofilament net that was attached to a rotor so echoes could be collected along the roll, tilt, and lateral axes of each fish. The temporal highlight structure of broadband echoes was determined by calculating the envelope of the cross-correlation function between the incident signal and the echoes. The echo waveforms were complex with many highlights and varied with the orientation of the fish. In the tilt plane, the strongest echoes occurred when the incident signal was perpendicular to the long axis of the swimbladder. The number of highlights was the fewest at this orientation. The number of echo highlights and the length of echoes increased as the fish was tilted from this orientation. The highlight structure of the echoes resulted in the transfer function being rippled, with local maxima and minima that changed with fish size and species. The echo structures in both the time and frequency domains were generally consistent within species and were easily distinguishable between species. (C) 2003 Acoustical Society of America.},

The approach uses a parametric version of the SALSA algorithm to fit regression splines to 1-dimensional curves in N dimensions (in practice N = 2 or 3). The knots of these splines are used as landmarks in a subsequent Principal Components Analysis, and the dives classified via agglomerative clustering. We demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm on simulated 2-dimensional dive data, and apply our method to real 3-dimensional whale dive data from the Behavioral Response Study (BRS) in the Bahamas.

abstract = {Increases in noise-generating human activities since the Industrial Revolution have changed the acoustic landscape of many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Anthropogenic noise is now recognized as a major pollutant of international concern, and recent studies have demonstrated impacts on, for instance, hearing thresholds, communication, movement and foraging in a range of species. However, consequences for survival and reproductive success are difficult to ascertain. Using a series of laboratory-based experiments and an open-water test with the same methodology, we show that acoustic disturbance can compromise antipredator behaviour - which directly affects survival likelihood - and explore potential underlying mechanisms. Juvenile European eels (Anguilla anguilla) exposed to additional noise (playback of recordings of ships passing through harbours), rather than control conditions (playback of recordings from the same harbours without ships), performed less well in two simulated predation paradigms. Eels were 50{\%} less likely and 25{\%} slower to startle to an 'ambush predator' and were caught more than twice as quickly by a 'pursuit predator'. Furthermore, eels experiencing additional noise had diminished spatial performance and elevated ventilation and metabolic rates (indicators of stress) compared with control individuals. Our results suggest that acoustic disturbance could have important physiological and behavioural impacts on animals, compromising life-or-death responses.},

abstract = {This study compares the folding of two polypeptides-bovine carbonic anhydrase (BCA) and peracetylated BCA (BCA-Ac-18)-having the same sequence of amino acids but differing by 18 formal units of charge, from a solution containing denaturing concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Acetylation of BCA with acetic anhydride converts all 18 lysine-(epsilon)-NH3+ groups to lysine-(epsilon)-NHCOCH3 groups and generates BCA-Ac-18. Both BCA and BCA-Ac-18 are catalytically active, and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) suggests that they have similar secondary and tertiary structures. SDS at concentrations above similar to 10 mM denatured both proteins. When the SDS was removed by dialysis, both proteins were regenerated in native form. This study suggests that large differences in the net charge of the polypeptide have no significant influence on the structure, the ability to refold, or the rate of refolding of this protein from solutions containing SIDS. This study reinforces the idea that charged residues on the surface of BCA do not guide protein folding and raises the broader question of why proteins have charged residues on their surface, outside of the region of the active site.},

abstract = {To understand complex sensory-motor behavior related to object perception by echolocating bats, precise measurements are needed for echoes that bats actually listen to during flight. Recordings of echolocation broadcasts were made from flying bats with a miniature light-weight microphone and radio transmitter (Telemike) set at the position of the bat's ears and carried during flights to a landing point on a wall. Telemike recordings confirm that flying horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum nippon) adjust the frequency of their sonar broadcasts to compensate for echo Doppler shifts. Returning constant frequency echoes were maintained at the bat's reference frequency +/- 83 Hz during flight, indicating that the bats compensated for frequency changes with an accuracy equivalent to that at rest. The flying bats simultaneously compensate for increases in echo amplitude as target range becomes shorter. Flying bats thus receive echoes with both stabilized frequencies and stabilized amplitudes. Although it is widely understood that Doppler-shift frequency compensation facilitates detection of fluttering insects, approaches to a landing do not involve fluttering objects. Combined frequency and amplitude compensation may instead be for optimization of successive frequency modulated echoes for target range estimation to control approach and landing.},

abstract = {In pinnipeds and especially in otariids, mothers and pups develop the capacity to recognize each other's voices. Pups become able to discriminate their mother's voice a few days after birth. For females, this discrimination seems to occur earlier, probably during the few hours after parturition. However, during lactation, mothers are confronted with a major problem: the change of the characteristics of their pup's calls. To investigate this problem, we first performed an acoustic analysis of pups' calls from birth to weaning to identity the successive different versions of these calls. Secondly, we performed playback experiments just before weaning to test if females retain these different versions over a long time period. The acoustic analysis of pups' calls reveals that several characteristics of their vocalizations change with age. Playback experiments demonstrate that females still recognize all the successive immature and mature versions of their pup's calls. In our opinion, this long-term memorization seems to be a by-product of the permanent pups' voice learning from birth to weaning since no apparent adaptive benefit seems to arise from this capacity (C) 2003 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {The low-frequency, powerful vocalizations of blue and fin whales may potentially be detected by conspecifics across entire ocean basins. In contrast, humpback and bowhead whales produce equally powerful, but more complex broadband vocalizations composed of higher frequencies that suffer from higher attenuation. Here we evaluate the active space of high frequency song notes of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in Western Greenland using measurements of song source levels and ambient noise. Four independent, GPS-synchronized hydrophones were deployed through holes in the ice to localize vocalizing bowhead whales, estimate source levels and measure ambient noise. The song had a mean apparent source level of 185±2 dB rms re 1 µPa @ 1 m and a high mean centroid frequency of 444±48 Hz. Using measured ambient noise levels in the area and Arctic sound spreading models, the estimated active space of these song notes is between 40 and 130 km, an order of magnitude smaller than the estimated active space of low frequency blue and fin whale songs produced at similar source levels and for similar noise conditions. We propose that bowhead whales spatially compensate for their smaller communication range through mating aggregations that co-evolved with broadband song to form a complex and dynamic acoustically mediated sexual display.},

abstract = {THE PROBLEM Underwater blast effects on divers received a great deal of attention up to the 1970s, and several investigators in the United States and the United Kingdom contributed to this work. Most of this research focused on the potentially lethal effects of the blast and used those to estimate safe diving distances. Several models were developed to make these estimates. The data used to drive the models were mostly conducted at shallow depths and with relatively small charges. METHOD A review of all information on underwater blast and their affect in divers was undertaken by the authors. FINDINGS There have been some more recent incidents which suggest that the current models of underwater blast may be incomplete and that additional data may be needed. Furthermore, there has been no systematic comparison of the various models. This review of underwater blast provides a brief background on the physical acoustics for underwater blast, summarizes the literature on the bioeffects for divers, and compares model results. The final chapter provides the author's views on necessary research to meet gaps in the models as well as describe the best application of our current knowledge to a guidance for underwater blast.},

The vocalizations of short-beaked and long-beaked common (Delphinus delphis and Delphinus capensis), Pacific white-sided (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), and bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus) dolphins were recorded in a pelagic environment of the Southern California Bight and the Gulf of California over a period of 4 years. Cepstral feature vectors are extracted from call data which contain simultaneous overlapping whistles, burst-pulses, and clicks from a single species. These features are grouped into multisecond segments. A portion of the data is used to train Gaussian mixture models of varying orders for each species. The remaining call data are used to test the performance of the models. Species are predicted based upon probabilistic measures of model similarity with test segment groups having durations between 1 and 25 s. For this data set, 256 mixture Gaussian mixture models and segments of at least 10 s of call data resulted in the best classification results. The classifier predicts the species of groups with 67{\%}-75{\%} accuracy depending upon the partitioning of the training and test data. (c) 2007 Acoustical Society of America.},

This study tests whether wild tufted capuchin monkeys () use alarm calls in a functionally deceptive manner to usurp food resources. If capuchins use alarm calls {\^{a}}€˜deceptively{\^{a}}€™, it was predicted that false alarms should be: (i) given by subordinates more than by dominants, (ii) more frequent when food is most contestable, (iii) more frequent when less food is available, and (iv) given when the caller is in a spatial position in which it could increase its feeding success if conspecifics react to the call. These predictions were tested by observing subjects in experimental contexts, in which the amount and distribution of a high-value resource (banana pieces) were manipulated using wooden platforms suspended from tree branches. While false alarms were non-significantly more common when more food was available, the three remaining predictions were supported. These results generally support the hypothesis that alarm calls are used by capuchins to reduce the effects of feeding competition. Whether this is intentional on the part of the caller requires further investigation.},

abstract = {Data collected from wild and captive bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, over the past five decades indicate that they produce individually distinctive signature whistles that function in individual recognition and in maintaining group cohesion. However, a recent study by McCowan {\&} Reiss (2001, Animal Behaviour, 62, 1151-1162) failed to detect signature whistles in nine of 12 captive bottlenose dolphins. These authors suggested that previous studies of signature whistles had used biased data sets, and claimed that the visual classification methods used by most researchers were inferior to their computerized technique. To evaluate their claims, we randomly selected 20 whistles from each of 20 bottlenose dolphins from recordings made during brief capture-release events in Sarasota Bay, FL, U.S.A., and asked 10 judges to visually group spectrograms based on similarity of their contours. Judges consistently grouped whistles according to the identity of the vocalizer; the mean number of whistles of a single dolphin in the judges' groups was 18.9 ± 1.6 out of 20 possible; resampling simulations indicate that it is highly unlikely (P {\textless} 0.0001) for this many whistles to be grouped together randomly. In contrast, the McCowan method was highly inaccurate at classifying whistles according to the identity of the vocalizer; whistles produced by multiple dolphins were grouped together. This study provides strong external validation for the reliability of visual classification of whistles, and confirms the presence of individually distinctive signature whistles in the vocal repertoire of bottlenose dolphins.},

abstract = {Geographic variations in the whistles of Hawai'ian spinner dolphins are discussed by comparing 27 spinner dolphin pods recorded in waters off the Islands of Kaua'i., O'ahu, Cana'i, and Hawai'i. Three different behavioral states, the number of dolphins observed in each pod, and ten parameters extracted from each whistle contour were considered by using clustering and discriminant function analyses. The results suggest that spinner dolphin pods in the Main Hawai'ian Islands share characteristics in approximately 48{\%} of their whistles. Spinner dolphin pods had similar whistle parameters regardless of the island, location, and date when they were sampled and the dolphins' behavioral state and pod size. The term "whistle-specific subgroup" (WSS) was used to designate whistle groups with similar whistles parameters (which could have been produced in part by the same dolphins). The emission rate of whistles was higher when spinner dolphins were socializing than when they were traveling or resting, suggesting that whistles are mainly used during close-range interactions. Spinner dolphins also seem to vary whistle duration according to their general behavioral state. Whistle duration and the number of turns and steps of a whistle may be more important in delivering information at the individual level than whistle frequency parameters.

abstract = {Swimming efficiencies of fish and cetaceans have been related to a certain synchrony between stroke cycle frequency, peak-to-peak tail/fluke amplitude and mean swimming speed. These kinematic parameters form a non-dimensional wake parameter, referred to as a Stroulial number, which for the range between 0.20 and 0.40 has been associated with enhanced swimming efficiency for fish and cetaceans. Yet to date there has been no direct experimental substantiation of what Strouhal numbers are preferred by swimming cetaceans. To address this lack of data, a total of 248 Stroubal numbers were calculated for the captive odontocete cetaceans Tursiops truncatus, Pseudorca crassidens, Orcinus orca, Globicephala melaena, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens and Stenella frontalis. Although the average Stroulial number calculated for each species is within the accepted range, considerable scatter is found in the data both within species and among individuals. A greater proportion of Strouhal values occur between 0.20 and 0.30 (74{\%}) than the 0.25-0.35 (55{\%}) range predicted for maximum swimming efficiency. Within 0.05 Stroulial increments, the greatest number of Strouhal values was found between 0.225 and 0.275 (44{\%}). Where propulsive efficiency data were available (Tursiops truncatus, Pseudorca crassidens, Orcinus orca), peak swimming efficiency corresponded to this same Stroulial range. The odontocete cetacean data show that, besides being generally limited to a range of Strouhal numbers between 0.20 and 0.40, the kinematic parameters comprising the Stroulial number provide additional constraints. Fluke-beat frequency normalized by the ratio of swimming speed to body length was generally restricted from 1 to 2, whereas peak-to-peak fluke amplitude normalized by body length occurred predominantly between 0.15 and 0.25. The results indicate that the kinematics of the propulsive flukes of odontocete cetaceans are not solely dependent on Stroulial number, and the Stroubal number range for odontocete cetaceans; occurs at slightly (similar to20{\%}) lower values than previously predicted for maximum swimming efficiency.},

The convenient mathematical assumptions of this original theory continue to channel researchers' attentions today. Although data tend to match these assumptions - flock members scan independently, vigilance sequences are essentially unpredictable, and interscan intervals are highly variable - the assumptions themselves are difficult to justify. Some of our basic ideas about vigilance require detailed re-examination.},

abstract = {Seals cope with regular exposure to diving hypoxia by storing oxygen in blood and skeletal muscles and by limiting the distribution of blood-borne oxygen to all but the most hypoxia vulnerable tissues (brain, heart), through dramatic cardiovascular adjustments. Still, arterial oxygen tension of freely diving seals regularly drops to levels that would be fatal to most non-diving mammals. Some cerebral protection is offered through diving-induced brain cooling and, possibly, enhanced oxygen delivery due to a particularly high brain capillary density. Here we test the hypothesis that seal neurons are in addition also intrinsically hypoxia tolerant. For this purpose we compared neuronal hypoxic responses in adult hooded seals and mice using intracellular recordings from the pyramidal layer of isolated visual cortex slices. Neurons from both species maintained normoxic membrane potentials of -60 to -70mV, which in seals increased by only 13.4+/-19.2mV (n=7) during the first 10min of severe hypoxia (oxygen content of saline perfusate reduced from approximately 75 to approximately 5{\%}), while the corresponding depolarization of mouse neurons was significantly larger (65.0+/-44.9mV; n=14; p=0.006). Mouse neurons moreover lost the ability to discharge after 5+/-2min in hypoxia, while seal neurons continued on average for 19+/-10min, in one case for a full hour. These results show that seal neocortical neurons exhibit a remarkable intrinsic hypoxia tolerance, which may partly explain why seals can dive for more than 1h and stay alert without suffering from detrimental effects of hypoxia.},

abstract = {How do birds select the sounds they mimic, and in what contexts do they use vocal mimicry? Some birds show a preference for mimicking other species' alarm notes, especially in situations when they appear to be alarmed. Yet no study has demonstrated that birds change the call types they mimic with changing contexts. We found that greater racket-tailed drongos (Dicrurus paradiseus) in the rainforest of Sri Lanka mimic the calls of predators and the alarm-associated calls of other species more often than would be expected from the frequency of these sounds in the acoustic environment. Drongos include this alarm-associated mimicry in their own alarm vocalizations, while incorporating other species' songs and contact calls in their own songs. Drongos show an additional level of context specificity by mimicking other species' ground predator-specific call types when mobbing. We suggest that drongos learn other species' calls and their contexts while interacting with these species in mixed flocks. The drongos' behaviour demonstrates that alarm-associated calls can have learned components, and that birds can learn the appropriate usage of calls that encode different types of information.},

abstract = {World-wide, underwater background noise levels are increasing due to anthropogenic activities. Little is known about the effects of anthropogenic noise on marine fish, and information is needed to predict any negative effects. Behavioural startle response thresholds were determined for eight marine fish species, held in a large tank, to tones of 0.1-64 kHz. Response threshold levels varied per frequency within and between species. For sea bass, the 50{\%} reaction threshold occurred for signals of 0.1-0.7 kHz, for thicklip mullet 0.4-0.7 kHz, for pout 0.1-0.25 kHz, for horse mackerel 0.1-2 kHz and for Atlantic herring 4 kHz. For cod, pollack and eel, no 50{\%} reaction thresholds were reached. Reaction threshold levels increased from approximately 100 dB (re 1 microPa, rms) at 0.1 kHz to approximately 160 dB at 0.7 kHz. The 50{\%} reaction thresholds did not run parallel to the hearing curves. This shows that fish species react very differently to sound, and that generalisations about the effects of sound on fish should be made with care. As well as on the spectrum and level of anthropogenic sounds, the reactions of fish probably depend on the context (e.g. location, temperature, physiological state, age, body size, and school size).},

abstract = {Animal signals are often used in more than one context or by more than one class of signaller. In the big-clawed snapping shrimp,Alpheus heterochaelis, the open chela display is a visual signal produced by both males and females. Thus, to respond appropriately to the open chela display in interactions, shrimp need information about the sex of the other individual. These experiments were performed to determine the effect of sex information from chemical signals on the response of shrimp to the visual signal of the open chela. First, chemical signals from males and females were presented alone. Shrimp did not respond differentially to chemical signals from males and females. Next, chemical signals were presented concurrently with the open chela display. Male shrimp showed a greater response to an open chela with male chemical signals than to an open chela with female chemical signals. Male response to an open chela with female chemical signals was also a function of the chela's relative size, and this size-relative response was less than the response to the open chela alone. Male response to an open chela with male chemical signals was independent of relative size. In contrast, females responded aggressively to open and closed chelae regardless of relative size, and regardless of concurrent chemical signals. The relative costs and benefits associated with aggressive and pair-forming interactions differ for males and females, and these differences are likely to contribute to the differences in assessment observed here.},

abstract = {Economists have long argued that a fishery that maximizes its economic potential usually will also satisfy its conservation objectives. Recently, maximum economic yield (MEY) has been identified as a primary management objective for Australian fisheries and is under consideration elsewhere. However, first attempts at estimating MEY as an actual management target for a real fishery (rather than a conceptual or theoretical exercise) have highlighted some substantial complexities generally unconsidered by fisheries economists. Here, we highlight some of the main issues encountered in our experience and their implications for estimating and transitioning to MEY. Using a bioeconomic model of an Australian fishery for which MEY is the management target, we note that unconstrained optimization may result in effort trajectories that would not be acceptable to industry or managers. Different assumptions regarding appropriate constraints result in different outcomes, each of which may be considered a valid MEY. Similarly, alternative treatments of prices and costs may result in differing estimates of MEY and their associated effort trajectories. To develop an implementable management strategy in an adaptive management framework, a set of assumptions must be agreed among scientists, economists, and industry and managers, indicating that operationalizing MEY is not simply a matter of estimating the numbers but requires strong industry commitment and involvement.},

abstract = {The marine sciences have undergone a sequence of historical changes related to new methodologies, approaches and challenges. Most recently, deteriorating natural ecosystems and threatened component species have prompted a renewed change in the focus of scientific research on the marine environment. This study analyzes the scientific literature on cetaceans during the period 2005–2008 to demonstrate that a key focus of modern research is on conservation-related topics, and then compares it to the period 1970–1973 to demonstrate that this new focus represents a shift from basic biological and ecological issues. On average, approximately 46{\%} of papers published on whales, dolphins and porpoises in 2005–2008 were categorized as conservation oriented versus focused on biology or ecology. This contrasts to approximately 10{\%} in 1970–1973. This shift parallels other marine research subjects, such as benthic communities, coral reefs and sea turtles and reflects a general paradigm shift in marine research towards anthropogenic impacts. This is important guidance for institutions and organizations that wish to base their agendas and decisions on state-of-the-art scientific priorities.},

abstract = {Forests return large quantities of C to the atmosphere through soil respiration (Rsoil), which is often conceptually separated into autotrophic C respired by living roots (Rroot) and heterotrophic decomposition (Rhet) of soil organic matter (SOM). Live roots provide C sources for microbial metabolism via exudation, allocation to fungal associates, sloughed-off cells, and secretions such as mucilage production, suggesting a coupling between the activity of roots and heterotrophs. We addressed the strength of root effects on the activity of microbes and exo-enzymes by removing live-root-C inputs to areas of soil with a trenching experiment. We examined the extent to which trenching affected metrics of soil heterotrophic activity (proteolytic enzyme activity, microbial respiration, potential net N mineralization and nitrification, and exo-enzyme activities) in a forest exposed to elevated atmospheric [CO2] and N fertilization, and used automated measurements of Rsoil in trenched and un-trenched plots to estimate Rroot and Rhet components. Trenching decreased many metrics of heterotrophic activity and increased net N mineralization and nitrification, suggesting that the removal of root-C inputs reduced Rhet by exacerbating microbial C limitation and stimulating waste-N excretion. This trenching effect was muted by N fertilization alone but not when N fertilization was combined with elevated CO2, consistent with known patterns of belowground C allocation at this site. Live-root-C inputs to soils and heterotrophic activity are tightly coupled, so root severing techniques like trenching are not likely to achieve robust quantitative estimates of Rroot or Rhet.},

abstract = {A field experiment on the effect of seismic shooting on the lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) was conducted on the fishing grounds in the southeastern part of the North Sea in May 2002. Sandeel buried in the sand at night were trapped in steel frame cages (2.0 x 1.8 x 2.0 m) deployed in positions with high abundance of fish located by a van Veen grab. In an experimental area, three sandeel cages were exposed to full-scale seismic shooting for about 2.5 d. Cameras in the cage and on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) were used to monitor the activity of the enclosed fish. A control area about 35 km southeast of the seismic shooting area was established with two sandeel cages. The distribution and abundance of the lesser sandeel during daytime in the experimental region were regularly monitored by acoustic surveying, but the present methodology could not demonstrate that seismic shooting caused any change in sandeel abundance. Repeated grab surveys were conducted using a van Veen grab for a predetermined set of localities almost every night during the experimental period, both prior to and after seismic shooting. The results indicate that the seismic shooting had a moderate effect on the behaviour of the lesser sandeel. We did not observe any immediate lethal effect, neither from the cage experiments nor from the grab samples. The total mortality in the cages of about 35{\%} on average, both in the experimental group and the control group, was probably a result of injuries during deployment, due to handling and confinement. Analyses of landing data from the Norwegian sandeel trawlers show a temporary drop in the sandeel landings for a short period after the seismic experiment.},

abstract = {Male humpback whales produce complex songs during the breeding season, yet the singing behaviour of males and whether songs function in male contests and/or through female choice are still poorly understood. We investigated song function by obtaining simultaneous observations of the positions and movements of singing and nonsinging whales in real time during their migration off the east coast of Australia. We collected movement data by acoustic tracking using a hydrophone array, land-based visual tracking and observations from a small boat. Of the 114 singers analysed, 66 ( 58{\%}) associated with conspecifics. Singers were significantly more likely to join groups containing a mother-calf pair than other groups. Males started to sing after joining groups only if they consisted of a mother-calf pair not escorted by another male. Singers also associated longer and sang for a significantly greater proportion of time with mother-calf pairs than any other group type. Associating with mother-calf pairs has been shown to be a reproductively successful strategy for males. In contrast, whales that joined singers were usually lone males; these associations were brief and singers typically stopped singing in the presence of other males. This is the highest reported incidence in humpback whales of males singing when escorting females and supports an intersexual function of song in humpback whales. We suggest that males joining singers are prospecting for females rather than engaging in male social ordering and that singing may incur the cost of attracting competing males.

abstract = {The dynamic interplay between static and sliding friction is fundamental to many animal movements. One interesting example of stick-slip friction is found in the soundproducing apparatus of many spiny lobster species (Palinuridae). The acoustic movements of the spiny lobster's plectrum over the file are generated by stick-slip friction between the two surfaces. We examined the microscopic anatomy, kinematics, acoustics and frictional properties of the California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) toward the goal of quantitatively characterizing the frictional and acoustic mechanics of this system. Using synchronous high-speed video and sound recordings, we tested whether plectrum kinematics are correlated with acoustic signal features and found that plectrum velocity is positively correlated with acoustic amplitude. To characterize the frictional mechanics of the system, we measured frictional forces during sound production using excised plectrums and files. Similar to rubber materials sliding against hard surfaces, the static coefficient of friction in this system was on average 1.7. The change in the coefficient of friction across each stick-slip cycle varied substantially with an average change of 1.1. Although driven at a constant speed, the plectrum slipped at velocities that were positively correlated with the normal force between the two surfaces. Studies of friction in biological systems have focused primarily on adhesion and movement, while studies of stick-slip acoustics have remained under the purview of musical acoustics and engineering design. The present study offers an integrative analysis of an unusual bioacoustic mechanism and contrasts its physical parameters with other biological and engineered systems.},

abstract = {Males of many songbird species participate in a distinct chorus beginning before sunrise. Despite its ubiquity, the function of dawn chorusing remains poorly understood. We tested the social dynamics hypothesis, which states that males sing at dawn to mediate their social relationships with neighbors through interactive communication. Using a 16-microphone acoustic location system, we recorded 29 entire dawn choruses in 10 neighborhoods of 6-10 territorial male black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) of known dominance rank. We analyzed song frequency matching and overlapping between neighboring males in 10 choruses and compared the intensity of these behaviors with social factors. Chickadees matched the frequency of their neighbor's songs more often than expected by chance. The level of matching was higher between neighbors who belonged to different flocks during the previous winter than between neighbors who had been flockmates. Males of the same dominance rank matched each other more than males of disparate ranks. There was no relationship between matching and pairing status or distance between opponents. Overlapping was used less than expected by chance. No measures of song overlapping were related to measured social factors. Our results show that neighboring male chickadees interact vocally at dawn by frequency matching. This is the first study to show that the intensity of songbird vocal interactions at dawn varies with social factors, supporting the social dynamics hypothesis.},

abstract = {Agent-based models can be used to simulate spatially-explicit animal behavioral processes and their interactions with human activities. This approach can be applied to predict the potential effects of such activities on animal behavior and individual condition that could lead, in turn, to alterations in vital rates and, ultimately, long-term population change. We developed an agent-based model to describe the effect of interactions with tourism on the behavior of bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound (New Zealand). The model describes the temporal variation of the individuals' hidden motivational states, the way in which these states interact to determine the activity of groups of dolphins, and the feedback influence of the group's activity on individual motivations and condition. Moreover, it realistically simulates the movement of dolphin groups in the fiord. The model also includes tour boat behavior, incorporating the way key geographical features attract these boats. In addition to tourism effects, we accounted for the spatial heterogeneity in both dolphin activities and shark predation risk. The final simulation platform generated a realistic representation of the social and behavioral dynamics of the dolphin and boat populations, as well as observed patterns of disturbance. We describe how this tool could be used to ensure effective management of the interactions between anthropogenic factors and bottlenose dolphins in Doubtful Sound, and how it could be adapted to evaluate the effects of human disturbance on other comparable populations. We then fitted the dolphin component of the model to data collected during visual studies of the Doubtful Sound dolphin population between 2000 and 2002 using a Bayesian multi-state modeling framework. However, when the parameter estimates from this fitting process were used in the agent-based model, biologically realistic representations of the population were not generated. Our results suggest that visual data from group follows alone are not sufficient to inform such agent-based models. Information on the spatial structure of the animals' activities and an appropriate measure of individual condition are also required for successful model parameterization.},

abstract = {We conducted a double blind experiment in an artisanal gillnet fishery in Argentina to determine the effectiveness of acoustic deterrents (pingers) at reducing bycatch of the Franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei). The fishery was conducted by small inflatable and fiberglass vessels operating between 0.5 and 7 krn from the coast. Each vessel carried an independent observer who was rotated from vessel to vessel throughout the course of the experiment. Information on the number of dolphins captured, geographic position, depth, configuration of fishing gear, soak time, biomass of fish caught, and sea lion predation in a string/net producing any damage was recorded. Equivalent numbers of active and silent pingers were used during the experiment. A total of 45 dolphins were caught in the silent nets, and seven were caught in the active pinger nets, demonstrating a highly significant reduction in bycatch for this species. However, sea-lions (Otaria flavescens) damaged the fish in active pinger nets significantly more than silent nets, and the damage increased over the course of the experiment. Although pingers show promise as a management tool for this species, pinniped depredation suggests that higher pinger frequencies will be needed to avoid a "dinner bell" effect.},

abstract = {The functional and ecological consequences of the directional emission of sounds used for communication remain largely unexplored even though non-uniform radiation patterns have been reported across a wide range of taxa. In this study the spectral structure of stereotyped calls recorded from groups of travelling killer whales (Orcinus orca) moving consistently toward or away from a towed hydrophone array was measured by comparing the energy in high-frequency ({\textgreater}5 kHz) with that in low-frequency (1-5 kHz) bands. Relative energy in high-frequency bands was significantly greater when animals were moving toward the hydrophone array, but only in call types that contain a separately modulated high-frequency component. The difference in relative energy as a function of direction of movement was more than 10 dB at the fundamental frequency of the high-frequency component of the two most common types recorded, confirming a strong pattern of mixed-directionality in these calls. Changes in call spectra due to signaler orientation to a receiver may provide an intrinsic cue of a moving signaler's direction of movement. Killer whales have sensitive hearing over the frequency range of this potential cue, and their marked behavioral synchrony suggests its use. The direction of movement cue inherent in the directionality pattern of calls may be an efficient and reliable means for this and possibly other highly mobile species to coordinate behavior and regulate spacing relative to other individuals.},

Climate change could affect these interactions in several ways. There may be direct effects of loss of the sea ice habitat, elevations of water and air temperature, and increased occurrence of severe weather. Some of the indirect effects of climate change on animal health will likely include alterations in pathogen transmission due to a variety of factors, effects on body condition due to shifts in the prey base/food web, changes in toxicant exposures, and factors associated with increased human habitation in the Arctic (e.g., chemical and pathogen pollution in the ru...},

abstract = {1. The hypothesis is presented that some odontocetes may debilitate prey by use of brief intense sounds. 2. In several cases, considering the feeding structures of a given odontocete species, it is not apparent how they capture the prey species on which they feed. Especially in these cases, prey should be able to outdistance the odontocete in question or outmaneuver it. 3. Some field observations are strongly suggestive of prey debilitation by odontocetes. Fish have been seen to lose orientation capability in the presence of ensonifying dolphins, and wild fish schools being fed upon by dolphins were found to be so lethargic they could be removed from the water by hand. 4. In the evolutionary development of modern odontocetes, feeding mechanisms have shifted from a modified terrestrial tooth row capable of entrapping prey (the cage jaw), to very elongate jaws (pincers jaws) capable of snapping prey from the water, in early Miocene dolphins, to the loss of such beaks and teeth in many modern forms which made their appearance in middle and late Miocene. The major means of ingestion has become suction, activated by a piston tongue. These trends seem associated with a narrowing of the emitted sound field, probably as an evolutionary response toward the development of increased range by their echolocation pulses. It is hypothesized that as the beam narrowed and intensified it began to disorient prey. These trends are tied to the telescoping and assymetry of the dolphin skull. 5. The sperm whale may catch its swift squid prey leaving no evident tooth marks, and such prey may be alive in sperm whale stomachs. The disparity between the speeds of the sperm whale and squid and the costs of sperm whale acceleration are discussed. Sperm whales eat a very wide-sized range of prey, and small items will not repay the costs of the whale's locomotion. The forehead sound-beaming anatomy is postulated to allow prey debilitation. 6. Bottlenose dolphins are known to emit sounds intense enough to kill fish, and probably also squid. 7. Some evidence implicates snapping shrimp in sonic prey stunning. 8. The major problem for the hypothesis is the lack of recordings of such very intense odontocete sounds at sea.},

To facilitate a quantitative analysis of the acoustic repertoire of Hector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori), a computer-based measurement system in a signal processing language (SIGPROC) has been developed. This automated system allowed us to easily measure descriptive features from 7661 dolphin clicks.  The reliability of the measurement system was confirmed by reconstructing some of the clicks from their measured features.  The measurement and reconstruction techniques are described. Analyses of the measured data showed that most Hector's dolphin vocalizations are simple, high-frequency, narrow-band "clicks."  A few examples of wideband clicks were found, as was a sound comprising two frequency components.},

abstract = {During echolocation, toothed whales produce ultrasonic clicks at extremely rapid rates and listen for the returning echoes. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) duration was evaluated in terms of latency between single peaks: 5.5 ms (from peak I to VII), 3.4 ms (I-VI), and 1.4 ms (II-IV). In comparison to the killer whale and the bottlenose dolphin, the ABR of the harbour porpoise has shorter intervals between the peaks and consequently a shorter ABR duration. This indicates that the ABR duration and peak latencies are possibly related to the relative size of the auditory structures of the central nervous system and thus to the animal's size. The ABR to a sinusoidal amplitude modulated stimulus at 125 kHz (sensitivity threshold 63 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa rms) was evaluated to determine the modulation rate transfer function of a harbour porpoise. The ABR showed distinct envelope following responses up to a modulation rate of 1,900 Hz. The corresponding calculated equivalent rectangular duration of 263 $\mu$s indicates a good temporal resolution in the harbour porpoise auditory system similar to the one for the bottlenose dolphin. The results explain how the harbour porpoise can follow clicks and echoes during echolocation with very short inter click intervals.},

abstract = {Cultural lineages are based on learned social traditions that are stable for several generations. When cultural lineages also reflect common ancestry and/or are shared by individuals that live together they are called clans. The existence of clans among killer whales has been previously proposed but has not been confirmed. Here, we show that clans exist among resident type killer whales, Orcinus orca, in southern Alaska. Resident killer whales live in stable matrilines from which emigration of either sex has not been observed. Matrilines that associate regularly ({\textgreater}=50{\%} observation time) are called pods. Pods are believed to consist of closely related matrilines and share a unique repertoire of discrete call types. Pods that share parts of their repertoire form what Ford (1991, Canadian Journal of Zoology,69, 1454-1483) called an acoustic clan. Here, we identified discrete call types of seven pods from southern Alaska, using a method based on human discrimination of distinct aural and visual (spectrogram) differences. Mitochondrial DNA of members of each pod was also analysed. The repertoires of the seven pods were compared and two acoustically distinct groups of pods were identified. Each group was monomorphic for a different mitochondrial D-loop haplotype. Nevertheless, pods from different clans associated frequently. It thus appears that the acoustic similarities within groups, which we presume to be cultural, reflect common ancestry, and that these groups therefore meet the above definition of clans. We also argue that a combination of cultural drift and selection are the main mechanisms for the maintenance of clans. Copyright 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

To identify the species responsible for this call, arrays of acoustic recorders were deployed in this same area during 2006 and 2007. 70 h of collocated visual observations at the center of each array were used to compare the localized occurrence of this call to the occurrence of three baleen whale species: right, humpback, and sei whales. The low frequency call was significantly associated only with the occurrence of sei whales. On average, the call swept from 82 to 34 Hz over 1.4 s and was most often produced as a single call, although pairs and (more rarely) triplets were occasionally detected. Individual calls comprising the pairs were localized to within tens of meters of one another and were more similar to one another than to contemporaneous calls by other whales, suggesting that paired calls may be produced by the same animal. A synthetic kernel was developed to facilitate automatic detection of this call using spectrogram-correlation methods. The optimal kernel missed 14{\%} of calls, and of all the calls that were automatically detected, 15{\%} were false positives. (C) 2008 Acoustical Society of America.},

The effect of each alarm was judged by comparing the animals' position and respiration rate during a test period with that during a baseline period. The XP-10 alarm produced 0.3 s tonal signals randomly selected from a set of 16 with fundamental frequencies between 9 and 15 kHz, with a constant pulse interval of 4.8 s (duty cycle 6{\%}). The 2MP alarm produced 0.3 s tonal signals randomly selected from a set of 16 with similar fundamental frequencies but with random pulse intervals of between 2 and 5 s (duty cycle 8{\%}). The frequency spectra and source levels of the 2MP and XP-10 alarms varied depending on the signal selected. The HS20-80 alarm produced a constant, but asymmetrical frequency modulated sinewave between 20 and 80 kHz with total pulse duration of 0.3 s, with random pulse intervals of between 2 and 5 s (duty cycle 4.6{\%}). The porpoises reacted to all three alarms by swimming away from them and by increasing their respiration rate. The XP-10, which on average had the highest source level, had the strongest effect.

abstract = {Abstract  The propagules of most species of reef fish are advected from the reef, necessitating a return to reef habitats at the end of the pelagic stage. There is increasing evidence of active attraction to the reef but the sensory abilities of reef fish larvae have not been characterized well enough to fully identify cues. The electrophysiological methods of auditory brainstem response (ABR) and electroolfactogram (EOG) were used to investigate auditory and olfactory abilities of pre- and post-settlement stages of a damselfish, Pomacentrus nagasakiensis (Pisces, Pomacentridae). Audiograms of the two ontogenetic stages were similar. Pre-settlement larvae heard as well as their post-settlement counterparts at all but two of the tested frequencies between 100 Hz and 2,000 Hz. At 100 and 600 Hz, pre-settlement larvae had ABR thresholds 8 dB higher than those of post-settlement juveniles. Both stages were able to detect locally recorded reef sounds. Similarly, no difference in olfactory ability was found between the two ontogenetic stages. Both stages showed olfactory responses to conspecifics as well as L-alanine. Therefore, the auditory and olfactory senses have similar capabilities in both ontogenetic stages. Settlement stage larvae of P. nagasakiensis can hear and smell reef cues but it is unclear as to what extent larvae use these sounds or smells, or both, as cues for locating settlement sites.},

abstract = {Salps are common in oceanic waters and have higher per-individual filtration rates than any other zooplankton filter feeder. Although salps are centimeters in length, feeding via particle capture occurs on a fine, mucous mesh (fiber diameter d approximately 0.1 microm) at low velocity (U = 1.6 +/- 0.6 cmxs(-1), mean +/- SD) and is thus a low Reynolds-number (Re approximately 10(-3)) process. In contrast to the current view that particle encounter is dictated by simple sieving of particles larger than the mesh spacing, a low-Re mathematical model of encounter rates by the salp feeding apparatus for realistic oceanic particle-size distributions shows that submicron particles, due to their higher abundances, are encountered at higher rates (particles per time) than larger particles. Data from feeding experiments with 0.5-, 1-, and 3-microm diameter polystyrene spheres corroborate these findings. Although particles larger than 1 microm (e.g., flagellates, small diatoms) represent a larger carbon pool, smaller particles in the 0.1- to 1-microm range (e.g., bacteria, Prochlorococcus) may be more quickly digestible because they present more surface area, and we find that particles smaller than the mesh size (1.4 microm) can fully satisfy salp energetic needs. Furthermore, by packaging submicrometer particles into rapidly sinking fecal pellets, pelagic tunicates can substantially change particle-size spectra and increase downward fluxes in the ocean.},

abstract = {In this study, the indirect (i.e. boats not involved in dolphin viewing activities) impacts of boat traffic on the acoustic behaviour of Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis, were assessed in Moreton Bay, Australia. Humpback dolphin acoustic behaviour is affected by transiting boat traffic. Boats{\&}apos; passage did not affect the rates at which dolphins produced click trains and burst pulse vocalizations. However, dolphins significantly increased their rate of whistling immediately after a boat moved through the area. This increase occurred only when boats were less than 1{\&}middot;5{\&}thinsp;km from the groups. Groups including mother{\&}ndash;calf pairs showed an increase in whistles in response to boats{\&}apos; passage. Groups with no calves produced significantly fewer whistles. This evidence suggests that the noise from transiting vessels affects dolphins{\&}apos; group cohesion. Mother{\&}ndash;calf pairs appear to be most disturbed by transiting vessels, and exhibit an increased need to re-establish vocal contact.},

abstract = {Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris Blainville) echolocate for prey during deep foraging dives. Here we use acoustic tags to demonstrate that these whales, in contrast to other toothed whales studied, produce two distinct types of click sounds during different phases in biosonar-based foraging. Search clicks are emitted during foraging dives with inter-click intervals typically between 0.2 and 0.4 s. They have the distinctive form of an FM upsweep (modulation rate of about 110 kHz ms(-1)) with a-10 dB bandwidth from 26 to 51 kHz and a pulse length of 270 mu s, somewhat similar to chirp signals in bats and Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris Cuvier), but quite different from clicks of other toothed whales studied. In comparison, the buzz clicks, produced in short bursts during the final stage of prey capture, are short (105 mu s) transients with no FM structure and a -10 dB bandwidth from 25 to 80 kHz or higher. Buzz clicks have properties similar to clicks reported from large delphinids and hold the potential for higher temporal resolution than the FM clicks. It is suggested that the two click types are adapted to the separate problems of target detection and classification versus capture of low target strength prey in a cluttered acoustic environment.},

abstract = {Ecosystem components interact in complex ways and change over time due to a variety of both internal and external influences (climate change, season cycles, human impacts). Such processes need to be modeled dynamically using appropriate statistical methods for assessing change in network structure. Here we use visualizations and statistical models of network dynamics to understand seasonal changes in the trophic network model described by Baird and Ulanowicz [Baird, D., Ulanowicz, R.E., 1989. Seasonal dynamics of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. Ecol. Monogr. 501 (59), 329–364] for the Chesapeake Bay (USA). Visualizations of carbon flow networks were created for each season by using a network graphic analysis tool (NETDRAW). The structural relations of the pelagic and benthic compartments (nodes) in each seasonal network were displayed in a two-dimensional space using spring-embedder analyses with nodes color-coded for habitat associations (benthic or pelagic). The most complex network was summer, when pelagic species such as sea nettles, larval fishes, and carnivorous fishes immigrate into Chesapeake Bay and consume prey largely from the plankton and to some extent the benthos. Winter was the simplest of the seasonal networks, and exhibited the highest ascendency, with fewest nodes present and with most of the flows shifting to the benthic bacteria and sediment POC compartments. This shift in system complexity corresponds with a shift from a pelagic- to benthic-dominated system over the seasonal cycle, suggesting that winter is a mostly closed system, relying on internal cycling rather than external input. Network visualization tools are useful in assessing temporal and spatial changes in food web networks, which can be explored for patterns that can be tested using statistical approaches. A simulation-based continuous-time Markov Chain model called SIENA was used to determine the dynamic structural changes in the trophic network across phases of the annual cycle in a statistical as opposed to a visual assessment. There was a significant decrease in outdegree (prey nodes with reduced link density) and an increase in the number of transitive triples (a triad in which i chooses j and h, and j also chooses h, mostly connected via the non-living detritus nodes in position i), suggesting the Chesapeake Bay is a simpler, but structurally more efficient, ecosystem in the winter than in the summer. As in the visual analysis, this shift in system complexity corresponds with a shift from a pelagic to a more benthic-dominated system from summer to winter. Both the SIENA model and the visualization in NETDRAW support the conclusions of Baird and Ulanowicz [Baird, D., Ulanowicz, R.E., 1989. Seasonal dynamics of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. Ecol. Monogr. 501 (59), 329–364] that there was an increase in the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem's ascendancy in the winter. We explain such reduced complexity in winter as a system response to lowered temperature and decreased solar energy input, which causes a decline in the production of new carbon, forcing nodes to go extinct; this causes a change in the structure of the system, making it simpler and more efficient than in summer. It appears that the seasonal dynamics of the trophic structure of Chesapeake Bay can be modeled effectively using the SIENA statistical model for network change.},

In birds, some anti-predator behaviours have been shown to be correlated with personality traits such as activity level and exploration. Here, we tested for a correlation between exploration behaviour and response latency time to a simulated fish predator attack in a fish species, juvenile convict cichlids (). Individual focal fish were subjected to a standardized attack by a robotic fish predator while foraging, and separately given two repeated trials of exploration of a novel environment. We found a strong positive correlation between exploration and time taken to respond to the predator model. Fish that were fast to explore the novel environment were slower to respond to the predator. Our study therefore provides some of the first experimental evidence for a link between exploration behaviour and predator-escape behaviour. We suggest that different behavioural types may differ in how they partition their attention between foraging and anti-predator vigilance.},

The 1/3-octave noise levels were compared with audiograms of harbor seals and harbor porpoises. Maximum 1/3-octave levels were in the range 106-126 dB re 1 microPa rms. Maximum range of audibility was estimated under two extreme assumptions on transmission loss (3 and 9 dB per doubling of distance, respectively). Audibility was low for harbor porpoises extending 20-70 m from the foundation, whereas audibility for harbor seals ranged from less than 100 m to several kilometers. Behavioral reactions of porpoises to the noise appear unlikely except if they are very close to the foundations. However, behavioral reactions from seals cannot be excluded up to distances of a few hundred meters. It is unlikely that the noise reaches dangerous levels at any distance from the turbines and the noise is considered incapable of masking acoustic communication by seals and porpoises.},

abstract = {Abstract  We characterised the effect of seasonal fluctuations in water temperature (Tw) on the nonventilatory period (NVP) of Mediterranean loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta. Ten captive turtles, that were subject to the natural variations in Tw found in the Gulf of Naples, dived significantly longer when Tw decreased. More than 50{\%} of summer and winter dives lasted between 2 and 10 min; the maximum dive duration (120 min) occurred in winter at a Tw of 13°C. The longest NVP coincided with a low level of activity and a lower food consumption. This, and a reduced metabolic rate consequent to acclimatisation to a low Tw were likely to have influenced NVP. },

abstract = {Global concern over the possible deleterious effects of noise on marine organisms was catalyzed when toothed whales stranded and died in the presence of high intensity sound. The lack of knowledge about mechanisms of hearing in toothed whales prompted our group to study the anatomy and build a finite element model to simulate sound reception in odontocetes. The primary auditory pathway in toothed whales is an evolutionary novelty, compensating for the impedance mismatch experienced by whale ancestors as they moved from hearing in air to hearing in water. The mechanism by which high-frequency vibrations pass from the low density fats of the lower jaw into the dense bones of the auditory apparatus is a key to understanding odontocete hearing. Here we identify a new acoustic portal into the ear complex, the tympanoperiotic complex (TPC) and a plausible mechanism by which sound is transduced into the bony components. We reveal the intact anatomic geometry using CT scanning, and test functional preconceptions using finite element modeling and vibrational analysis. We show that the mandibular fat bodies bifurcate posteriorly, attaching to the TPC in two distinct locations. The smaller branch is an inconspicuous, previously undescribed channel, a cone-shaped fat body that fits into a thin-walled bony funnel just anterior to the sigmoid process of the TPC. The TPC also contains regions of thin translucent bone that define zones of differential flexibility, enabling the TPC to bend in response to sound pressure, thus providing a mechanism for vibrations to pass through the ossicular chain. The techniques used to discover the new acoustic portal in toothed whales, provide a means to decipher auditory filtering, beam formation, impedance matching, and transduction. These tools can also be used to address concerns about the potential deleterious effects of high-intensity sound in a broad spectrum of marine organisms, from whales to fish.},

@article{Masters1979,
abstract = {1.Many insects stridulate when they are handled or attacked. It has been suggested that this disturbance stridulation acts to deter predators. This hypothesis was investigated in a series of experiments. Predators were given insects which had been silenced by disruption of their sound-producing mechanism or else had been sham operated but retained their normal ability to stridulate.2.Three types of insects (mutillid wasps, Dasymutilla spp.; water scavenger beetles, Tropisternus spp.; and round sand beetles, Omophron labiatus) were given to wolf spiders (Lycosa ceratiola and Geolycosa ornatipes) at night in the field under natural conditions. When attacking silenced insects, spiders displayed greater persistence than when attacking phonic insects (Table 1). In addition, mortality was greater among silenced insects.3.Spiders (L. ceratiola) were also given an artificial ‘insect'—a vibrating probe whose vibration mimicked that of the cuticle of a stridulating insect. As with real insects, spiders persisted longer in their attack on the probe when it was silent than when it was ‘stridulating”.4.Female mutillid wasps were given to wild-caught mice (Peromyscus floridanus) in the laboratory. Unsilenced mutillids survived the encounter more often than their silenced counterparts. In another experiment, the stings of mutillid wasps were removed before testing. Mice killed nearly all these ‘unprotected' mutillids. However, it took mice significantly longer to attack unsilenced mutillids and longer to kill them after initiating the assault (Table 2).5.These results support the view that insect disturbance stridulation deters predators. Two modes of action by which these sounds may have their effect are discussed: they may serve to startle the attacker or they may alert it to the potential harmfulness of the insect and as such may qualify as an example of acoustic aposematism.},

abstract = {Reports of humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) song chorusing occurring outside the breeding grounds are becoming more common, but song structure and underwater behavior of individual singers on feeding grounds and migration routes remain unknown. Here, ten humpback whales in the Western Antarctic Peninsula were tagged in May 2010 with non-invasive, suction-cup attached tags to study foraging ecology and acoustic behavior. Background song was identified on all ten records, but additionally, acoustic records of two whales showed intense and continuous singing, with a level of organization and structure approaching that of typical breeding ground song. The songs, produced either by the tagged animals or close associates, shared phrase types and theme structure with one another, and some song bouts lasted close to an hour. Dive behavior of tagged animals during the time of sound production showed song occurring during periods of active diving, sometimes to depths greater than 100 m. One tag record also contained song in the presence of feeding lunges identified from the behavioral sensors, indicating that mating displays occur in areas worthy of foraging. These data show behavioral flexibility as the humpbacks manage competing needs to continue to feed and to prepare for the breeding season during late fall. This may also signify an ability to engage in breeding activities outside of the traditional, warm water breeding ground locations.},

abstract = {Recordings of white-beaked dolphin whistles were made in Faxafloi Bay (Iceland) using a three-hydrophone towed linear array. Signals from the hydrophones were routed through an amplifier to a lunch box computer on board the boat and digitized using a sample rate of 125 kHz per channel. Using this method more than 5000 whistles were recorded. All recordings were made in sea states 0-1 (Beaufort scale). Dolphins were located in a 2D horizontal plane by using the difference of arrival time to the three hydrophones, and source levels were estimated from these positions using two different methods (I and II). Forty-three whistles gave a reliable location for the vocalizing dolphin when using method II and of these 12 when using method I. Source level estimates on the center hydrophone were higher using method I [average source level 148 (rms) +/- 12 dB, n= 36] than for method II [average source level 139 (rms) +/- 12 dB, n = 36]. Using these rms values the maximum possible communication range for whistling dolphins given the local ambient noise conditions was then estimated. The maximum range was 10.5 km for a dolphin whistle with the highest source level (167 dB) and about 140 m for a whistle with the lowest source level (118 dB). Only two of the 43 whistles contained an unequal number of harmonics recorded at the three hydrophones judging from the spectrograms. Such signals could be used to calculate the directionality of whistles, but more recordings are necessary to describe the directionality of white-beaked dolphin whistles.

Echolocation clicks are represented by cepstral feature vectors that are classified by Gaussian mixture models. A randomized cross-validation experiment is designed to provide conditions similar to those found in a field-deployed system. To prevent matched conditions from inappropriately lowering the error rate, echolocation clicks associated with a single sighting are never split across the training and test data. Sightings are randomly permuted before assignment to folds in the experiment. This allows different combinations of the training and test data to be used while keeping data from each sighting entirely in the training or test set. The system achieves a mean error rate of 22{\%} across 100 randomized three-fold cross-validation experiments. Four of the six species had mean error rates lower than the overall mean, with the presumed Cuvier's beaked whale clicks showing the best performance ({\textless}2{\%} error rate). Long-beaked common and bottlenose dolphins proved the most difficult to classify, with mean error rates of 53{\%} and 68{\%}, respectively.},

abstract = {Theoretical models predict that in species with obligate biparental care, individuals will partially compensate for decreased parental effort by their partners as a stable evolutionary strategy. Full compensation may occur when breeding success is an accelerating function of parental effort, especially in long-lived bird species. We experimentally examined the effect of time-depth recorders (TDRs) on body mass and parental behaviour of thick-billed murres, Uria lomvia, and evaluated the effect of TDRs as handicaps to test whether individuals compensate for decreased partner effort and whether compensation is sex biased. Compared with control birds, TDR-equipped birds had reduced body mass, offspring attendance, number of foraging trips and feeding rates, and males had increased foraging trip duration. in general, males lost mass at a higher rate and made longer foraging trips than females. Partners of TDR-equipped birds compensated for their mates' reduced parental effort by increasing offspring attendance and by increasing chick provisioning above average rates of control birds. Although partners of TDR-equipped birds fully compensated for their mates' reduced offspring attendance (i.e. chicks were never observed to be left unattended), total provisioning rates of pairs with a TDR-equipped bird ((X) over bar +/-SE=4.38+/-0.26 meals/day) were significantly lower than those of control pairs (5.74+/-0.31 meals/day). However, fledgling success of control and TDR-equipped birds did not differ between reproductive seasons. TDR-equipped birds also had a significantly lower rate of return to breed than their non-TDR-equipped partners or control birds, and those that did return the following season were more likely to change mates (32{\%}) compared with controls (0{\%}). Taken together, our results underline the need to quantify the effects of monitoring equipment used to measure seabirds' activities, and indicate the ability of female and male thick-billed murres to compensate for reduced partner effort due to handicapping-Compensator behaviour seems to be a necessary response of this single-brooded species to ensure current breeding success; however, it may affect the stability of pair bonds in some individuals.

abstract = {Prey animals can survive a predatory encounter if they communicate unprofitability to an approaching predator. Otherwise undefended prey often use conspicuous deimatic (frightening) displays to intimidate closely approaching predators into delaying or aborting an attack. The [`]startle' displays of several insect groups are the best-known example: comprising a sudden size increase coupled with a conspicuous [`]eyespot' pattern, these displays can effectively deter highly dangerous avian predators, although they are often unsuccessful. Cephalopods perform remarkably similar visual displays that are presumed to function in the same way, although evidence for this is lacking. Unlike large insects, cephalopods possess rapid escape responses, and seem unlikely to benefit from predator hesitation. Moreover, field and laboratory-based observations with cuttlefish suggest that what has previously been labelled the Deimatic Display may be directed towards small teleosts that pose little or no direct predation risk. In staged encounters between cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, and large predatory fish (sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax and smooth hound Mustelus mustelus), na{\"{i}}ve cuttlefish did not perform their Deimatic Display towards large predators, even when spatially constrained and unable to flee. Cuttlefish also discriminated between large predators, selectively using a different visual signal (previously termed the Flamboyant Display) towards the more dangerous teleost fish. These results strongly suggest that, although superficially similar, cephalopod deimatic displays are functionally different to insect displays: large brains and keen senses allow cuttlefish to discriminate between species, and selectively signal to small and only indirectly threatening teleost intruders, rather than highly dangerous predators.},

abstract = {Trawling bats use echolocation not only to detect and classify acoustically continuous cues originated from insects at and above water surfaces, but also to detect small water-dwelling prey items breaking the water surface for a very short time, producing only transient cues to be perceived acoustically. Generally, bats need to adjust their echolocation behavior to the specific task on hand, and because of the diversity of prey cues they use in hunting, trawling bats should be highly flexible in their echolocation behavior. We studied the adaptations in the behavior of Noctilio leporinus when approaching either a continuous cue or a transient cue that disappeared during the approach of the bat. Normally the bats reacted by dipping their feet in the water at the cue location. We found that the bats typically started to adapt their calling behavior at approximately 410 ms before prey contact in continuous cue trials, but were also able to adapt their approach behavior to stimuli onsets as short as 177 ms before contact, within a minimum reaction time of 50.9 ms in response to transient cues. In both tasks the approach phase ended between 32 and 53 ms before prey contact. Call emission always continued after the end of the approach phase until around prey contact. In some failed capture attempts, call emission did not cease at all after prey contact. Probably bats used spatial memory to dip at the original location of the transient cue after its disappearance. The duration of the pointed dips was significantly longer in transient cue trials than in continuous cue trials. Our results suggest that trawling bats possess the ability to modify their generally rather stereotyped echolocation behavior during approaches within very short reaction times depending on the sensory information available.},

abstract = {Begging signals from the young are used to elicit parental care. Although honest and parent-directed signalling seems to be widely shared characteristic of begging behaviour, offspring might modify their strategy under some ecological or environmental constraints. In the subantarctic fur seal, Arctocephalus tropicalis, mothers forage at sea for 2-3 weeks at a time throughout the lactation period, resulting in regular separations of mothers and pups. Using playback experiments we investigated modifications of pups' begging behaviour during their mother's absence. From the 1st to the 5th day of maternal absence, pups rarely begged in response to other adult females' vocalizations (17.6-46.7{\%} of tested pups), but always responded specifically to their mother's. After its mother had been absent for 5-10 days, the pup's response to playback of strange females' calls was stronger (46-69{\%} of tested pups), but the specificity of the response to the mother remained. However, after the 11th day of maternal absence, pups become highly responsive to calls made by any adult female (up to 37{\%} of tested pups). The variation in responsiveness of fur seal pups during their mother's absence may be explained by changes in their motivational state that were linked to their internal nutritional balance.},

abstract = {At Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, catches of fish larvae by light traps that broadcast nocturnal reef sounds (noisy traps) were compared with catches by quiet traps over two 2{\textperiodcentered}5 week new-moon periods in November (XI) 2000 and January (I) 2001. Three areas were sampled: near-reef (NR, 500 m from the shore) in I, middle (M, 650 m) in I and XI and offshore (O, {\textgreater}1000 m) in XI. The most abundant taxa captured were Apogonidae, Blenniidae, Chaetodontidae, Lethrinidae, Mullidae and Pomacentridae. Significant differences in catch were found between areas, and a position effect was found at the O and M areas. At the NR and M areas, no taxa had significantly greater catches in quiet traps, but larvae of five taxa had significantly greater catches in noisy traps. These were (areas and times of greater catches): Apogonidae (NR; M XI), Mullidae (M I {\&} XI), Pomacentridae (NR; M I {\&} XI), Serranidae (M I) and Sphyraenidae (NR). At the offshore area, five taxa (Apogonidae, Blenniidae, Chaetodontidae, Mullidae and Pomacentridae) had significantly greater catches in quiet traps and only Lethrinidae had significantly greater catches in noisy traps. Thus some taxa (particularly apogonids and pomacentrids which had catches up to 155{\%} greater in noisy traps, but also lethrinids and mullids, and perhaps others), were attracted to reef sounds at night, but this apparently varied with location and time. The sound-enhanced catches imply a radius of attraction of the sound 1{\textperiodcentered}0220131{\textperiodcentered}6 times that of the light. More than 65 m from the speaker,the broadcast sound levels at frequencies typical of fish hearing were equivalent to background levels, providing a maximum radius of sound attraction in this experiment.},

abstract = {Some beaked whale species are susceptible to the detrimental effects of anthropogenic noise. Most studies have concentrated on the effects of military sonar, but other forms of acoustic disturbance (e.g. shipping noise) may disrupt behavior. An experiment involving the exposure of target whale groups to intense vessel-generated noise tested how these exposures influenced the foraging behavior of Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) in the Tongue of the Ocean (Bahamas). A military array of bottom-mounted hydrophones was used to measure the response based upon changes in the spatial and temporal pattern of vocalizations. The archived acoustic data were used to compute metrics of the echolocation-based foraging behavior for 16 targeted groups, 10 groups further away on the range, and 26 non-exposed groups. The duration of foraging bouts was not significantly affected by the exposure. Changes in the hydrophone over which the group was most frequently detected occurred as the animals moved around within a foraging bout, and their number was significantly less the closer the whales were to the sound source. Non-exposed groups also had significantly more changes in the primary hydrophone than exposed groups irrespective of distance. Our results suggested that broadband ship noise caused a significant change in beaked whale behavior up to at least 5.2 kilometers away from the vessel. The observed change could potentially correspond to a restriction in the movement of groups, a period of more directional travel, a reduction in the number of individuals clicking within the group, or a response to changes in prey movement.},

abstract = {The potential effects of exposing marine mammals to military sonar is a current concern. Dose-response relationships are useful for predicting potential environmental impacts of specific operations. To reveal behavioral response thresholds of exposure to sonar, we conducted 18 exposure/control approaches to 6 long-finned pilot whales. Source level and proximity of sonar transmitting one of two frequency bands (1-2kHz and 6-7kHz) were increased during exposure sessions. The 2-dimensional movement tracks were analyzed using a changepoint method to identify the avoidance response thresholds which were used to estimate dose-response relationships. No support for an effect of sonar frequency or previous exposures on the probability of response was found. Estimated response thresholds at which 50{\%} of population show avoidance (SPLmax=170dB re 1$\mu$Pa, SELcum=173dB re 1$\mu$Pa(2)s) were higher than previously found for other cetaceans. The US Navy currently uses a generic dose-response relationship to predict the responses of cetaceans to naval active sonar, which has been found to underestimate behavioural impacts on killer whales and beaked whales. The navy curve appears to match more closely our results with long-finned pilot whales, though it might underestimate the probability of avoidance for pilot-whales at long distances from sonar sources.},

abstract = {Acute effects of anthropogenic sounds on marine mammals, such as from military sonars, energy development, and offshore construction, have received considerable international attention from scientists, regulators, and industry. Moreover, there has been increasing recognition and concern about the potential chronic effects of human activities (e.g., shipping). It has been demonstrated that increases in human activity and background noise can alter habitats of marine animals and potentially mask communications for species that rely on sound to mate, feed, avoid predators, and navigate. Without exception, regulatory agencies required to assess and manage the effects of noise on marine mammals have addressed only the acute effects of noise on hearing and behavior. Furthermore, they have relied on a single exposure metric to assess acute effects: the absolute sound level received by the animal. There is compelling evidence that factors other than received sound level, including the activity state of animals exposed to different sounds, the nature and novelty of a sound, and spatial relations between sound source and receiving animals (i.e., the exposure context) strongly affect the probability of a behavioral response. A more comprehensive assessment method is needed that accounts for the fact that multiple contextual factors can affect how animals respond to both acute and chronic noise. We propose a three-part approach. The first includes measurement and evaluation of context-based behavioral responses of marine mammals exposed to various sounds. The second includes new assessment metrics that emphasize relative sound levels (i.e., ratio of signal to background noise and level above hearing threshold). The third considers the effects of chronic and acute noise exposure. All three aspects of sound exposure (context, relative sound level, and chronic noise) mediate behavioral response, and we suggest they be integrated into ecosystem-level management and the spatial planning of human offshore activities.},

abstract = {Clupeiform fish species, including the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) that belong to the subfamily Alosinae, can detect ultrasound. Clupeiform fishes are unique in that they have specialized gas-filled bullae in the head associated with the ear via the bulla membrane and with the lateral line via the lateral recess membrane. It has been hypothesized that the utricle of the inner ear is responsible for ultrasound detection through a specialized connection to the gas-filled bullae complex. Here, we show that the lateral line and its connection to the gas-filled bullae complex via the lateral recess are involved in ultrasound detection in Gulf menhaden. Removal of a small portion of the lateral line overlying the lateral recess membrane eliminates the ability of Gulf menhaden to detect ultrasound. We further show that the gas-filled bullae vibrates in response to ultrasound, that the gas-filled bullae are necessary for detecting ultrasound, and that the bullae connections to the lateral line via the lateral recess membrane play an important role in ultrasound detection. These results add a new dimension to the role of the lateral line and bullae as part of the ultrasonic detection system in Gulf menhaden.},

abstract = {Otophysine fishes have a series of bones, the Weberian ossicles, which acoustically couple the swimbladder to the inner ear. These fishes have evolved a diversity of sound-generating organs and acoustic signals, although some species, such as the goldfish, are not known to be vocal. Utilizing a recently developed auditory brainstem response (ABR)-recording technique, the auditory sensitivities of representatives of seven families from all four otophysine orders were investigated and compared to the spectral content of their vocalizations. All species examined detect tone bursts from 100 Hz to 5 kHz, but ABR-audiograms revealed major differences in auditory sensitivities, especially at higher frequencies ({\textgreater}1 kHz) where thresholds differed by up to 50 dB. These differences showed no apparent correspondence to the ability to produce sounds (vocal versus non-vocal species) or to the spectral content of species-specific sounds. All fishes have maximum sensitivity between 400 Hz and 1,500 Hz, whereas the major portion of the energy of acoustic signals was in the frequency range of 100--400 Hz (swimbladder drumming sounds) and of 1--3 kHz (stridulatory sounds). Species producing stridulatory sounds exhibited better high-frequency hearing sensitivity (pimelodids, doradids), except for callichthyids, which had poorest hearing ability in this range. Furthermore, fishes emitting both low- and high-frequency sounds, such as pimelodid and doradid catfishes, did not possess two corresponding auditory sensitivity maxima. Based on these results it is concluded that selective pressures involved in the evolution of the Weberian apparatus and the design of vocal signals in otophysines were others (primarily predator or prey detection in quiet freshwater habitats) than those serving to optimize acoustical communication.},

abstract = {Most bats use ultrasonic sonar signals, or cries, to locate prey. Many of their insect prey species have evolved an ability to hear and respond to these signals, and studies clearly demonstrate the survival value associated with this ability. Like bats, toothed whales locate prey by emitting ultrasonic sonar signals, or clicks. As a parallel to the insect prey of bats, it would seem obvious to assume that some fish species likewise are capable of sensing the ultrasonic clicks of their odontocete predators. As judged from classical fish audiometry literature, this seems not to be the case, however, and although in recent years some fishes have been proven responsive to ultrasound, examination of ecological and acoustic differences reveals that conclusions on ultrasound-mediated insect escape behavior are not immediately applicable to fish. This has the consequence that future experiments on fish ultrasound detection should not be looking for observations directly parallel to those observed in the bat-insect interactions.},

According to this view, song copying is a form of deceptive mimicry. We show that first-year great tits do not share more songs than expected with the previous occupants of their territories, nor are shared songs used more often than other songs in their repertoires. Songs are shared with neighbours but not selectively with established neighbours and there is no difference in reproductive success between great tits sharing with established neighbours and with first-year neighbours. We discuss the general applicability of the deceptive mimicry hypothesis and suggest that song sharing between neighbours may be advantageous for reasons other than deceptive mimicry.},

abstract = {Although glucocorticoid hormones are considered important physiological regulators for surviving adverse environmental stimuli (stressors), evidence for such a role is sparse and usually extrapolated from glucocorticoid effects under laboratory, short-term and/or non-emergency conditions. Gal{\~{A}}¡pagos marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) provide an excellent model for determining the ultimate function of a glucocorticoid response because susceptibility to starvation induced by El Ni{\~{A}}±o conditions is essentially their only major natural stressor. In a prospective study, we captured 98 adult male marine iguanas and assessed four major components of their glucocorticoid response: baseline corticosterone titres; corticosterone responses to acute stressors (capture and handling); the maximal capacity to secrete corticosterone (via adrenocorticotropin injection); and the ability to terminate corticosterone responses (negative feedback). Several months after collecting initial measurements, weak El Ni{\~{A}}±o conditions affected the Gal{\~{A}}¡pagos and 23 iguanas died. The dead iguanas were typified by a reduced efficacy of negative feedback (i.e. poorer post-stress suppression of corticosterone release) compared with surviving iguanas. We found no prior differences between dead and alive iguanas in baseline corticosterone concentrations, responses to acute stressors, nor in capacity to respond. These data suggest that a greater ability to terminate a stress response conferred a survival advantage during starvation.},

In an earlier experiment, we found that established neighbours typically reply to playback of neighbour-shared song with a different song they share with that neighbour ([`]repertoire matching'), rather than with the same song ([`]type matching') or with a nonshared song. In the present experiment, we considered the hypothesis that type matching is a threat or warning signal (Krebs et al. 1981, Animal Behaviour, 29, 918-923). We tested the specific prediction that a bird is more likely to type-match early in the breeding season when territory boundaries are new and still unstable, and more likely to repertoire-match later in the season, once those boundaries have become well established. Birds were played a shared song of a new neighbour once early (April) and again late (June) in the breeding season. As predicted, early in the season birds usually type-matched the playback (73{\%} of the trials) but late in the season they type-matched only rarely (18{\%}); birds never replied (early or late) with a nonshared song type.},

Environmental Impact Statements (EIS's) can be prepared using differing analysis methods to estimate the impact on marine mammals. To assess consistency in assessment methods, differences in the base assumptions were investigated; in particular, differences that arise between assumptions of dynamic marine mammals (animat method) and static distributions of marine mammals (static distribution method). Using several ocean environment scenarios and species, it is demonstrated that differences consistently arise between the two methods. The static distribution method underestimates the number of behavioral harassments compared with the animat method. Repeating many simulations with the animat method provides a robust risk assessment, provides a measure of variability, and allows the probability of "spurious events" to be estimated.},

However, movement data from individuals are intrinsically stochastic and often subject to severe observation error. Linking such complex data to dynamical models of movement is a major challenge for animal ecology. Here, we review a statistical approach, state-space modelling, which involves changing how we analyse movement data and draw inferences about the behaviours that shape it. The statistical robustness and predictive ability of state-space models make them the most promising avenue towards a new type of movement ecology that fuses insights from the study of animal behaviour, biogeography and spatial population dynamics.},

Polarization-sensitive measurements reveal a striking anisotropy in the PL intensity recorded parallel and perpendicular to the long axis of a nanowire. The order-of-magnitude polarization anisotropy was quantitatively explained in terms of the large dielectric contrast between these freestanding nanowires and surrounding environment, as opposed to quantum confinement effects. This intrinsic anisotropy was used to create polarization-sensitive nanoscale photodetectors that may prove useful in integrated photonic circuits, optical switches and interconnects, near-field imaging, and high-resolution detectors.},

abstract = {Increasing use of active low-frequency sonar by submarines and ships raises the risk of accidental exposure of recreational divers to low-frequency underwater sound (LFS). This study aimed to characterize the subjective responses of recreational scuba divers to LFS to ascertain the extent to which LFS may impact their enjoyment, comfort, or time spent underwater. Seventeen male and nine female recreational scuba divers participated. Diving was conducted in an acoustically transparent tank located within a larger anechoic pool. Subjects wore scuba gear and were positioned I m below the surface in a prone position. The sound transducer was located 4 m directly below the diver's head. Sound exposures consisted of three signal types (pure tone, 30 Hz hyperbolic sweep up, and 30 Hz hyperbolic sweep down) each presented at six center frequencies from 100 to 500 Hz and six sound pressure levels(SPL) ranging from 130 to 157 dB re 1 microPa. The duration of each sound exposure was 7 s. Subjects responded via an underwater console to rate aversion to LFS on a category-ratio scale, and to indicate the presence or absence of vibration of any body part. Aversion to LFS and the percent incidence of vibration increased as the SPL increased. The percent incidence of vibration decreased linearly with increasing frequency. At the highest SPL the probability that an aversion rating would exceed Very Severe (7 on the category-ratio scale) was predicted to be 19{\%}. There was no significant difference in aversion among signal types. The 100 Hz frequency was the most aversive frequency (P {\textless} 0.05). A plot of aversion vs. frequency showed a U-shaped function with minimum aversion at 250 Hz. In conclusion, diver aversion to LFS is dependent upon SPL and center frequency. The highest aversion rating was given for 100 Hz, this frequency corresponded with the greatest probability of detecting vibration. Factors other than vibration seem to account for aversion to the highest frequencies. Our data suggest that LFS exposures up to 145 dB re 1 microPa at frequencies between 100 and 500 Hz will have minimal impact on the recreational diver.},

abstract = {Bats use echolocation or biosonar to navigate and find prey at night. They emit short ultrasonic calls and listen for reflected echoes. The beam width of the calls is central to the function of the sonar, but directionality of echolocation calls has never been measured from bats flying in the wild. We used a microphone array to record sounds and determine horizontal directionality for echolocation calls of the trawling Daubenton's bat, Myotis daubentonii, flying over a pond in its natural habitat. Myotis daubentonii emitted highly directional calls in the field. Directionality increased with frequency. At 40kHz half-amplitude angle was 25°, decreasing to 14° at 75kHz. In the laboratory, M. daubentonii emitted less intense and less directional calls. At 55kHz half-amplitude angle was 40° in the laboratory versus 20° in the field. The relationship between frequency and directionality can be explained by the simple piston model. The model also suggests that the increase in the emitted intensity in the field is caused by the increased directionality, focusing sound energy in the forward direction. The bat may increase directionality by opening the mouth wider to emit a louder, narrower beam in the wild.},

Two species of western Atlantic sciaenids were examined: weakfish (Cynoscion regalis, Block and Schneider) and spot (Leiostomus xanthurus, Lacepede). These species differ in the anatomical relationship between the swim bladder and the inner ear. In weakfish, the swim bladder has a pair of anterior horns that terminate close to the ear, while there are no extensions of the swim bladder in spot. Thus, the swim bladder in spot terminates at a greater distance from the ear when compared to weakfish. With the use of the auditory brainstem response technique, Cynoscion regalis were found to detect frequencies up to 2000 Hz, while Leiostomus xanthurus detected up to 700 Hz. There were, however, no significant interspecific differences in auditory sensitivity for stimuli between 200 and 700 Hz. These data support the hypothesis that the swim bladder can potentially expand the frequency range of detection.},

abstract = {Very little is known about the acoustic repertoire of the Pacific humpback dolphin Sousa chinensis. This study, off eastern Australia, used concurrent observations of surface behaviour and acoustic recordings to gain an insight into the behavioural significance of humpback dolphin vocalizations. Humpback dolphins exhibit five different vocalization categories: broad band clicks; barks; quacks; grunts; and whistles. Broad band clicks were high in frequency (8 kHz to {\textgreater} 22 kHz), were directly related to foraging behaviour and may play a role in social behaviour. Barks and quacks were burst pulse sounds (frequency: 0.6 kHz to {\textgreater} 22 kHz, duration: 0.120138 s) and were associated with both foraging and social behaviour. The grunt vocalization is a low frequency narrow band sound (frequency 0.520132.6 kHz, duration 0.0620132 s) and was only heard during socializing. There were 17 different types of whistles, ranging widely in frequency (0.9201322 kHz) and vocal structure (n=329). The predominant whistle types used by the groups were type 1 (46{\%}) and type 2 (17{\%}). Most whistles were heard during both socializing and foraging. The number of whistles recorded in a group increased significantly as the number of mother2013calf pairs increased, suggesting that whistles may be used as contact calls. Few vocalizations were heard during either travelling or milling behaviours. Broad band clicks, barks and whistle type 1 were the only vocalizations recorded during either travelling or milling.},

abstract = {Toothed whales produce sound in their nasal complex by pneumatic actuation of phonic lip pairs within the blowhole. It has been hypothesized that dual actuation of the phonic lip pairs can generate two pulses that merge to form a single echolocation click with a higher source level, broader bandwidth and larger potential for beam steering than if produced by a single pair of phonic lips. Here, we test that hypothesis by measuring the sound production of five echolocating delphinids using hydrophones around the animals and imbedded in on-animal suction cups. We show that the studied animals click with their right pair of phonic lips and whistle with their left pair. We demonstrate that, with just a single pair of phonic lips, they can change the click energy levels over five orders of magnitude, change the click centroid frequencies over more than two octaves, and modulate the sound radiation from the melon for beam steering. We conclude that all of the click dynamics ascribed to dual actuation of two phonic lip pairs can be achieved with actuation of just the right pair of phonic lips, and we propose that the large dynamic range of source outputs is achieved by highly controlled modulation of the pneumatic driving pressure, the tension of the phonic lip labia and the conformation of the fatty melon and associated air sacs.},

abstract = {We combined observations of individual male bearded seal, Erignathus barbabus, behaviour at sea with acoustic localization techniques to investigate their reproductive strategies. Data on trill vocalizations and dive behaviour were collected over consecutive years during the seals' mating season in Svalbard, Norway. Males showed stereotypical dive and vocal displays, with clear individual variation. Acoustic localization provided at-sea locations for 17 males based on variation in trill parameters. Kernel home range analyses showed that 12 individuals displayed at set locations (95{\%} KERNELS=0.27-1.93 km2) and five other males displayed within considerably larger geographical areas (95{\%} KERNELS=5.31-12.5 km2). Males that used the set locations maintained single discrete core areas (50{\%} kernels), while males with large areas moved between multiple core areas. Movement patterns of males suggest that those with small areas patrolled aquatic territories, while those that used larger areas appeared to [`]roam'. Territorial males showed little spatial overlap, while roaming males overlapped substantially with both territorial and other males' areas. Territorial males had significantly longer trills than roamers. We suggest that trill duration may be a useful indicator of male [`]quality'. Territorial male bearded seals may be [`]successful' individuals while roaming males may be younger animals or males in poorer condition that are unable to maintain an aquatic territory. Our data on underwater vocalizations and movements of male bearded seals thus provide evidence for the use of alternative mating tactics in this species.Copyright 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {Studies evaluating effects of human activity on wildlife typically emphasize short-term behavioral responses from which it is difficult to infer biological significance or formulate plans to mitigate harmful impacts. Based on decades of detailed behavioral records, we evaluated long-term impacts of vessel activity on bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in Shark Bay, Australia. We compared dolphin abundance within adjacent 36-km2 tourism and control sites, over three consecutive 4.5-year periods wherein research activity was relatively constant but tourism levels increased from zero, to one, to two dolphin-watching operators. A nonlinear logistic model demonstrated that there was no difference in dolphin abundance between periods with no tourism and periods in which one operator offered tours. As the number of tour operators increased to two, there was a significant average decline in dolphin abundance (14.9{\%}; 95{\%} CI=-20.8 to -8.23), approximating a decline of one per seven individuals. Concurrently, within the control site, the average increase in dolphin abundance was not significant (8.5{\%}; 95{\%} CI=-4.0 to +16.7). Given the substantially greater presence and proximity of tour vessels to dolphins relative to research vessels, tour-vessel activity contributed more to declining dolphin numbers within the tourism site than research vessels. Although this trend may not jeopardize the large, genetically diverse dolphin population of Shark Bay, the decline is unlikely to be sustainable for local dolphin tourism. A similar decline would be devastating for small, closed, resident, or endangered cetacean populations. The substantial effect of tour vessels on dolphin abundance in a region of low-level tourism calls into question the presumption that dolphin-watching tourism is benign.},

Since European settlement in Queensland, various human activities have exploited these resources. We present documentary and oral history evidence of the scale of those industries. Based on extensive archival and oral history research, we argue that diverse fishing practices occurred and that the sustained exploitation of dugongs, green turtles, and hawksbill turtles led to observable declines in the numbers of these animals 2013 now species of conservation concern.},

This call has been described for regions offshore of Oregon, Washington, and California, USA and the Sea of Cortez, Mexico (reviewed in Rivers 1997). Data collected from moored hydrophones in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) indicate that the A-B pattern is common in this region as well. There is consistency in this call type throughout the eastern North Pacific and throughout the year. This acoustic evidence indicates continuity between blue whales in the ETP and those found west of North America.

abstract = {Sound pulses were projected into the forehead of a neonate, female sperm whale that died following a stranding and attempts to revive it. Two hydrophones, held against the skin, recorded the sound pulses and their reflections. A consistent reflection was found about 0.8 ms after sound projection. This time corresponded to the expected two-way travel time back and forth within the spermaceti organ. Reflections were also detected at the frontal surface of the junk from sounds projected into the distal sac area. These signals must have traversed rearward along the axis of the spermaceti organ to the frontal sac where they were likely reflected and directed forward to the front of the junk, demonstrating an acoustic continuum between the spermaceti organ and the junk. These results support the basic Norris and Harvey ( 1972) theory of sound generation in sperm whales and later amendments to that theory (Mohl and Amundin (1991), Mohl (2001)).

Previous experiments have yielded ambiguous results leaving it unclear what cues might have been used by passively listening dolphins to discriminate between different phase altered signals. This study used a phantom echo generator to produce computer controlled echoes. The dolphin interacted with the system in a real echolocation task to discriminate between simulated targets that were unaltered and those that had a 180° phase shift. The frequency amplitude spectral content between the two targets was the same. There were no temporal differences between the two targets. The only cue that the dolphin could use to discriminate between them was the 180° phase shift. The dolphin preformed at a success level of 40{\%} in discriminating the two echoes. This indicates that the 180° phase shift was not perceived.},

abstract = {Abstract is from a conference talk. The T-POD (Time-POrpoise Detector, Chelonia, U.K.) is a self-contained acoustic data logger used for detecting and monitoring the presence of vociferous dolphins and porpoises. It has become a standard tool in many environmental impact assessments and monitoring programs. Yet, little is known about the variability in sensitivity and detection range of T-PODs. In this study the threshold of ten T-PODs were determined in a small tank using 100ms long 130kHz pulses mimicking the sonar signal of harbour porpoises. The thresholds of the T-PODs were defined as the sound pressure at which only half of the transmitted pulses were recorded by the T-POD. The threshold was measured at four angles of incidence in the horizontal plane. The mean threshold ranged from 114 to 123dB re 1uPa (peRMS). Following threshold determination the ten units were deployed at short inter-T-POD distances for 8 days in an area with high occurrence of harbour porpoises (Great Belt, Denmark). The total number of clicks recorded ranged from 6232 to 11580 with a linear relationship between T-POD threshold (in dBs) and the number of recorded clicks (r2 = 0.73). Number of encounters pr T-POD decreased with increasing threshold (r2=0.4), whereas mean waiting time increased (0.52). Frequency ({\%} of the day with clicks) decreased with increasing thresholds (r2 = 0.69), whereas intensity (mean number of clicks per minute for periods with clicks) was not correlated strongly with T-POD sensitivity (r2 = 0.54). This study shows that individual threshold calibration of T-PODs is necessary to obtain comparable results from monitoring odontocetes with this tool.},

abstract = {Grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) breed both on land and on the ice. In January 1991, 36 h of underwater recordings were made from Amet Island, located in ice-covered waters in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. All vocalizations were examined for spectral and temporal structure and then classified into 1 of 7 call types. The majority of calls consisted of guttural ''rups'' and ''rupes'' (frequency = 100 - 3000 Hz), and low-frequency growls (100-500 Hz). Other less common vocalizations were low-frequency clicks (3000 Hz), as well as loud knocks, similar to knocking vocalizations recorded in walrus, and which had not been described previously for grey seals. The total number of vocalizations and the number of specific call types showed seasonal variations. The rate of vocalizations increased with the intensity of social activity and with the number of agonistic behaviors during the progression of the breeding season. Comparisons between night and day showed some changes in the vocal repertoire. Low-frequency clicks were recorded more often during darkness (17.1{\%} of calls) than in daylight (1.9{\%}), and when ice cover was more extensive.},

The 3-D diving behaviour in one complete (34 min) and four incomplete (6-36 min) dives was observed using passive acoustic localization. The vertical swim speed was 0.8-1.4 m/s, and the horizontal swim speed was 0.2-2.6 m/s. The maximum dive depth of an individual track ranged from 358 to 1494 m. The bottom depth was 500 to 1600 m and a scattering layer was present at 250 m. Clicks were usually emitted with inter-click intervals (ICI) of 0.5-2 s in blocks of 29-249 clicks, interspaced by pauses of 6-117 s. The length of blocks decreased with depth in a manner predictable from a pneumatic sound generator. Click sequences with shorter inter-click intervals, denoted creaks and believed to indicate feeding events, were located at depths from 278 to 1245 m. This study suggests that sperm whales exploit prey in a large part of the water column below the scattering layer and use an air-driven sound production system.},

abstract = {The process of model selection includes making an assumption about the distribution of ‘errors' about the mean response. Generalized linear models (GLMs) offer considerable flexibility in this regard. However, graphical methods for identifying potential error distributions can fail to discriminate among sets of candidate error distributions. I examine an information-theoretic approach to this issue, which ranks candidate models (error distributions) using Akaike's information criterion (AIC). I evaluate the effectiveness of this technique using Monte Carlo simulation by generating pseudorandom data from five skewed distributions: lognormal, gamma, Weibull, log-logistic, and inverse Gaussian. I then fit each data set under all five distributional assumptions, and examine how well AIC identifies the distribution that generated the data. On the basis of the simulations, I suggest that AIC is effective at identifying the data-generating distribution, given moderate to large sample sizes. I then fit four candidate models to data drawn from a mixture of four distributions with common expectations and coefficients of variation (CVs). AIC did not show strong support for a particular candidate model given small samples of ‘mixed' data, although larger samples selected the gamma distribution for CVs of 0.5 and 1.0, and the Weibull distribution for CVs of 1.5 and 2.0. Finally, I apply this technique in a GLM setting to several fisheries-independent and -dependent data sets to select the error distribution that is best supported by the data. Twenty-one out of 24 fisheries data sets examined showed strong support for one of the five candidate error distributions and the remaining moderate support for two.},

abstract = {In Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, mothers must identify their own young among hundreds or even thousands of pups, if they are to invest in their own offspring and avoid misdirecting their parental care. When returning to their breeding colony from a foraging trip of several days at sea, mothers have to find and identify their young before suckling can occur. There appears to be little confusion about which pup belongs to a mother, and adoption is absent or rare. Using behavioral observations, we investigated the means by which female Antarctic fur seals identified their pups in a breeding colony of about 750 mother-pup pairs on Kerguelen Island. We evaluated the importance of vision, scent communication, vocalizations, and rendezvous locations as possible explanations of how mothers find their pups. Every pup that a mother examined, whether her own or not, exchanged naso-nasal inspection with her, suggesting a strong role for olfactory communication in individual recognition. Both mothers and pups called to each other, and mothers that searched for pups over a longer period gave more calls and encountered more pups. Thus, vocalizations may have been used to attract pups that might be offspring. Nursing usually occurred in the same place from the end of one maternal visit to the colony and the arrival at the beginning of the next visit, suggesting that nursing locations may serve as a meeting place, or rendezvous, for mothers and pups. These results suggest that finding pups is a two-stage process for females, in which pups for sampling are attracted by calls or examined at the previous nursing location, and then individual identification is made by olfactory cues.},

Peak energy in the narrowband porpoise click spectrum occurred at 142 kHz, with negligible energy below 100 kHz. Energy was more diffuse in the spectra of broadband clicks, with a tendency towards higher frequencies. Mean pulse duration of narrowband clicks was 104 microseconds, whereas mean pulse duration of broadband clicks was 61 microseconds. Generally, finless porpoise clicks were inaudible to the human ear, except on occasion when faint, but distinct, pulses were heard from animals close to the hydrophone.},

The success of the program is based on local participation of the fishing villages, including the employment of former egg poachers to patrol the beaches and protect the nests, education programs, and ecotourism. The majority of stations are staffed year round and not only promote the conservation of endangered sea turtles, but also organize community festivals, support local schools and health care facilities, and assist in developing alternative sources of income for residents who once relied on the exploitation of sea turtles.

abstract = {The mechanism of sound reception and the hearing abilities of the prawn (Palaemon serratus) have been studied using a combination of anatomical, electron microscopic and electrophysiological approaches, revealing that P. serratus is responsive to sounds ranging in frequency from 100 to 3000 Hz. It is the first time that the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) recording technique has been used on invertebrates, and the acquisition of hearing ability data from the present study adds valuable information to the inclusion of an entire sub-phylum of animals when assessing the potential impact of anthropogenic underwater sounds on marine organisms. Auditory evoked potentials were acquired from P. serratus, using two subcutaneous electrodes positioned in the carapace close to the supraesophageal ganglion and the statocyst (a small gravistatic organ located below the eyestalk on the peduncle of the bilateral antennules). The morphology of the statocyst receptors and the otic nerve pathways to the brain have also been studied, and reveal that P. serratus possesses an array of sensory hairs projecting from the floor of the statocyst into a mass of sand granules embedded in a gelatinous substance. It is the purpose of this work to show that the statocyst is responsive to sounds propagated through water from an air mounted transducer. The fundamental measure of the hearing ability of any organism possessing the appropriate receptor mechanism is its audiogram, which presents the lowest level of sound that the species can hear as a function of frequency. The statocyst of P. serratus is shown here to be sensitive to the motion of water particles displaced by low-frequency sounds ranging from 100 Hz up to 3000 Hz, with a hearing acuity similar to that of a generalist fish. Also, recorded neural waveforms were found to be similar in both amplitude and shape to those acquired from fish and higher vertebrates, when stimulated with low-frequency sound, and complete ablation of the electrophysiological response was achieved by removal of the statocyst.},

abstract = {Many teleost fish generate acoustic signals for vocal communication by the synchronized, high-frequency contraction of skeletal, sonic muscles. In midshipman, eight groups of brainstem neurons were distinguished after biocytin application to the sonic nerve that, we propose, represent the entire vocal motor circuit. Biocytin-filled terminals were ubiquitous within all areas containing labeled neurons and, together with ultrastructural evidence, suggested a serial, transneuronal transport at synaptic sites between at least three neuronal groups. The most intensely labeled neurons were positioned in the caudal brainstem and included a previously characterized pacemaker-motoneuron circuit and a newly recognized ventral medullary nucleus that itself gave rise to extensive commissural and lateral brainstem bundles linking the pacemaker circuitry to the rostral brainstem. Five additional groups formed a column rostrally within the medial brainstem adjacent to eighth nerve (octaval)-recipient nuclei largely presumed to be acoustic. This column extended dorsally up to the ventricular cell layer and as far anterior as midbrain isthmal levels. The best-defined group was in the octaval efferent nucleus that directly innervates the sacculus that is considered the auditory division of the inner ear. Saccular afferents and neurons throughout the medial column were also filled after biocytin application to the saccular nerve. This vocal-acoustic network overlaps low-threshold, electrical stimulation sites in the rostral brainstem that elicit vocalizations. The medial column must therefore be the origin of the descending pathway controlling activation of the vocal pacemaker circuitry and likely forms the basis for acoustically elicited vocalizations. We suggest this network, together with input from the pacemaker circuitry, is also the origin of a vocal-related, corollary discharge to acoustic nuclei. Direct links between vocal and acoustic brain regions are thus traits common to aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates.},

abstract = {One of the needs of the Pelagos Sanctuary for the Conservation of Mediterranean Marine Mammals is information on critical habitats for cetaceans. This study modelled habitat use and preferences of fin whales and striped dolphins (the two most abundant species in the area) with the aim of providing this information, using sighting data collected between 1993 and 1999. The study area was divided into a 21 latitude by 21 longitude grid. The explanatory variables considered in the models were physiographic variables (mean, range and standard deviation of depth and slope, and distance from the nearest coastline) and remotely-sensed data (Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll-a concentration). The former were calculated for each cell using GIS tools, while the latter were obtained from AVHRR and SeaWiFS sensors. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with multidimensional smoothers were used to model the distribution of fin whales and striped dolphins in relation to these variables, and Classification And Regression Trees were used for habitat characterization and predictive models. The GAMs were coupled with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) to account for temporal autocorrelation in the errors and to help ensure model selection was reliable; the QIC statistic was used alongside GEE-based p-values. Bathymetric features were the most valuable predictors in the Pelagos Sanctuary area for both species. Sea Surface Temperature values were indicators of striped dolphin and fin whale presence, with both species showing a tendency to prefer colder waters (21-24 degrees C). Chl-a levels were selected by the GAM models only for striped dolphins, and with large associated uncertainty; this may be related to the relatively brief period examined (only 2 years) and/or to any functional relationship operating at a different geographical or temporal scale. The boosted classification trees however indicated an importance of Chl-a for both species. The techniques applied to this dataset proved to be valuable tools to describe habitat use and preferences of cetaceans, and the use of the remotely-sensed data can substantially improve the predictions. The results of this study will be used for assessing critical habitats within the Pelagos Sanctuary and will provide information for conservation and management in the Sanctuary.

abstract = {Humpback whales ( Megaptera novaeangliae) exhibit a variety of foraging behaviours, but neither they nor any baleen whale are known to produce broadband clicks in association with feeding, as do many odontocetes. We recorded underwater behaviour of humpback whales in a northwest Atlantic feeding area using suction-cup attached, multi-sensor, acoustic tags (DTAGs). Here we describe the first recordings of click production associated with underwater lunges from baleen whales. Recordings of over 34 000 'megapclicks' from two whales indicated relatively low received levels at the tag ( between 143 and 154 dB re 1 mu Pa pp), most energy below 2 kHz, and interclick intervals often decreasing towards the end of click trains to form a buzz. All clicks were recorded during night-time hours. Sharp body rolls also occurred at the end of click bouts containing buzzes, suggesting feeding events. This acoustic behaviour seems to form part of a night-time feeding tactic for humpbacks and also expands the known acoustic repertoire of baleen whales in general.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the relationship between the number of offspring produced (recruitment) and adult abundance is fundamental to forecasting the dynamics of an exploited population. Although small-scale experiments have documented the importance of maternal quality to offspring survival in plants and animals, the effects of this association on the recruitment dynamics of exploited populations are largely unknown. Here, we present results from both a simple population model and a meta-analysis of time-series data from 25 species of exploited marine fishes that suggest that a population of older, larger individuals has a higher maximum reproductive rate than an equivalent population of younger, smaller individuals, and that this difference increases with the reproductive lifespan of the population. These findings (i) establish an empirical link between population age structure and reproductive rate that is consistent with strong effects of maternal quality on population dynamics and (ii) provide further evidence that extended age structure is essential to the sustainability of many exploited fish stocks.},

abstract = {The ability to modify vocalizations to compensate for environmental noise is critical for successful communication in a dynamic acoustic environment. Many marine species rely on sound for vital life functions including communication, navigation and feeding. The impacts of significant increases in ocean noise levels from human activities are a current area of concern for the conservation of marine mammals. Here, we document changes in calling behaviour by individual endangered North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in increased background noise. Right whales, like several bird and primate species, respond to periods of increased noise by increasing the amplitude of their calls. This behaviour may help maintain the communication range with conspecifics during periods of increased noise. These call modifications have implications for conservation efforts for right whales, affecting both the way whales use sound to communicate and our ability to detect them with passive acoustic monitoring systems.},

abstract = {Previous research on the cetacean auditory system has consisted mostly of behavioral studies on a limited number of species. Little quantitative physiologic data exists on cetacean hearing. The frequency range of hearing varies greatly across different mammalian species. Differences among species correlate with differences in the middle-ear transfer function. Middle-ear transfer functions depend on the mechanical stiffness of the middle ear and the cochlear input impedance. The purpose of this study was to measure the middle-ear stiffness for the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), a species specialized for underwater high-frequency hearing and echolocation. Middle-ear stiffness was measured with a force probe that applied a known displacement to the stapes and measured the restoring force. The average middle-ear stiffness in ten dolphin ears was 1.37 N/mum, which is considerably higher than that reported for most terrestrial mammals. The relationship between middle-ear stiffness and low-frequency hearing cutoff in Tursiops was shown to be comparable to that of terrestrial mammals},

abstract = {A unique whale call with 50-52 Hz emphasis from a single source has been tracked over 12 years in the central and eastern North Pacific. These calls, referred to as 52-Hz calls, were monitored and analyzed from acoustic data recorded by hydrophones of the US Navy Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) and other arrays. The calls were noticed first in 1989, and have been detected and tracked since 1992. No other calls with similar characteristics have been identified in the acoustic data from any hydrophone system in the North Pacific basin. Only one series of these 52-Hz calls has been recorded at a time, with no call overlap, suggesting that a single whale produced the calls. The calls were recorded from August to February with most in December and January. The species producing these calls is unknown. The tracks of the 52-Hz whale were different each year, and varied in length from 708 to 11,062 km with travel speeds ranging from 0.7 to 3.8 km/h. Tracks included (A) meandering over short ranges, (B) predominantly west-to-east movement, and (C) mostly north-to-south travel. These tracks consistently appeared to be unrelated to the presence or movement of other whale species (blue, fin and humpback) monitored year-round with the same hydrophones.},

abstract = {Vocal learning is relatively common in birds but less so in mammals. Sexual selection and individual or group recognition have been identified as major forces in its evolution. While important in the development of vocal displays, vocal learning also allows signal copying in social interactions. Such copying can function in addressing or labelling selected conspecifics. Most examples of addressing in non-humans come from bird song, where matching occurs in an aggressive context. However, in other animals, addressing with learned signals is very much an affiliative signal. We studied the function of vocal copying in a mammal that shows vocal learning as well as complex cognitive and social behaviour, the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Copying occurred almost exclusively between close associates such as mother-calf pairs and male alliances during separation and was not followed by aggression. All copies were clearly recognizable as such because copiers consistently modified some acoustic parameters of a signal when copying it. We found no evidence for the use of copying in aggression or deception. This use of vocal copying is similar to its use in human language, where the maintenance of social bonds appears to be more important than the immediate defence of resources.},

abstract = {Like most otariids species, the Subantarctic fur seal breeds on land in large, dense colonies. Pups are confronted by the long and repetitive absences of their mother throughout lactation. At each mother's return, pups have to find her among several hundreds of congeners. This recognition process mainly relies on acoustic signals. We performed an acoustic analysis on 125 calls from 20 females recorded during the 1999-2000 breeding season on Amsterdam Island (Indian Ocean). Ten variables were measured in both temporal and frequency domains. To find the acoustic parameters supporting individual signature, we assessed the differences between individuals using Kruskall-Wallis univariate analysis of variance. For each variable, we also calculated the potential of individuality coding (PIC) as the ratio between the between-individual coefficient of variation and the mean value of the within-individual coefficients of variation. We found that the frequency spectrum, the characteristics of the frequency modulation of the initial and middle part of the call and the call duration exhibit an important individual stereotypy (PIC values ranging between 1.5 and 3), whereas features relative to amplitude and the frequency modulation of the final part of the call are weakly individualized (PIC values between I and 1.2).},

abstract = {This study was performed to assess the extent to which an intermandibular angle sensor (IMASEN) may be used to elucidate the behaviour of six captive loggerhead turtles. The measuring system was glued to the beak of turtles and set to measure the intermandibular distance at 5 Hz while the turtles fed (on anchovies, squid, and live crabs), swam, rested, and breathed. The behaviour of the equipped turtles was filmed and compared afterwards to the sensor readings. The IMASEN output data allowed quantification of the number of food items ingested as well as the time between food seizure and deglutition and the type of food ingested. However, nonfeeding turtles exhibited regular jaw movements with a reduced amplitude of ca. 2.2 mm, which clearly differed from feeding movements and were caused by buccal oscillations. Such movements of the base of the buccal cavity generate a steady flow of water pass the chemosensory organs and were interrupted only during food ingestion, resting, and breathing. Breathing was clearly distinguishable by the IMASEN. The beak sensor is thus a reliable system to investigate a number of behaviours in sea turtles which encompass foraging, buccal oscillation, and respiratory frequency. It has potential for allocating time to different activities in free-ranging sea turtles and thus allows us to gain insight to their foraging and diving strategies.},

abstract = {No-take zones may protect populations of targeted marine species and restore the integrity of marine ecosystems, but it is unclear whether they benefit top predators that rely on mobile pelagic fishes. In South Africa, foraging effort of breeding African penguins decreased by 30 per cent within three months of closing a 20 km zone to the competing purse-seine fisheries around their largest colony. After the fishing ban, most of the penguins from this island had shifted their feeding effort inside the closed area. Birds breeding at another colony situated 50 km away, whose fishing grounds remained open to fishing, increased their foraging effort during the same period. This demonstrates the immediate benefit of a relatively small no-take zone for a marine top predator relying on pelagic prey. Selecting such small protected areas may be an important first conservation step, minimizing stakeholder conflicts and easing compliance, while ensuring benefit for the ecosystems within these habitats.},

A lateral line analogue in cephalopods: Water waves generate microphonic potentials in the epidermal head lines of Sepia officinalis and Lolliguncula brevis. J. Comp. Physiol. A 164:1–5.); however, the biological significance of the epidermal lines remains unclear. To test whether cuttlefish show behavioural responses to local water movements, juvenile Sepia officinalis were exposed to local sinusoidal water movements of different frequencies (0.01–1000 Hz) produced by a vibrating sphere. Five behavioural responses were recorded: body pattern changing, moving, burrowing, orienting, and swimming. Cuttlefish responded to a wide range of frequencies (20–600 Hz), but not to all of the frequencies tested within that range. No habituation to repeated stimuli was seen. Results indicate that cuttlefish can detect local water movements (most likely with the epidermal head and arm lines) and are able to integrate that information into behavioural responses.},

abstract = {In this article, we propose a generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach for correlated ordinal or nominal multinomial responses using a local odds ratios parameterization. Our motivation lies upon observing that: (i) modeling the dependence between correlated multinomial responses via the local odds ratios is meaningful both for ordinal and nominal response scales and (ii) ordinary GEE methods might not ensure the joint existence of the estimates of the marginal regression parameters and of the dependence structure. To avoid (ii), we treat the so-called "working" association vector $\alpha$ as a "nuisance" parameter vector that defines the local odds ratios structure at the marginalized contingency tables after tabulating the responses without a covariate adjustment at each time pair. To estimate $\alpha$ and simultaneously approximate adequately possible underlying dependence structures, we employ the family of association models proposed by Goodman. In simulations, the parameter estimators with the proposed GEE method for a marginal cumulative probit model appear to be less biased and more efficient than those with the independence "working" model, especially for studies having time-varying covariates and strong correlation.},

abstract = {Abstract  This study investigated species recognition based on bark calls and full threat calls (FTCs) in three fur seal species, Antarctic Arctocephalus gazella, subantarctic A. tropicalis and New Zealand A. forsteri, that breed sympatrically and hybridize at subantarctic Macquarie Island. Bark calls, which are produced by males in male–female interactions, were more species-specific than their full threat calls, suggesting that bark calls could be used in species recognition and female mate choice. Further, the bark calls of A. tropicalis were more species-specific than those of A. gazella and A. forsteri, suggesting that divergence of calls between species is a consequence of phylogenetic distance, or has resulted from sexual selection through female mate choice. We believe the latter is more probable as we did not observe similar divergence in the FTCs of males. As such, the highly divergent bark calls of A. tropicalis may have resulted from sexual selection that has promoted pre-mating isolation via the process of reinforcement. },

We conducted playback experiments with cycling female mice to explore the function of male mouse songs. Using a place preference design, we show that these vocalizations elicited approach behaviour in females. In contrast, the playback of whistle-like artificial control sounds did not evoke approach responses. Surprisingly, the females also did not respond to pup isolation calls. In addition, female responses did not vary in relation to reproductive cycle, i.e. whether they were in oestrus or not. Furthermore, our data revealed a rapid habituation of subjects to the experimental situation, which stands in stark contrast to other species' responses to courtship vocalizations. Nevertheless, our results clearly demonstrate that male mouse songs elicit females' interest.},

abstract = {It has been predicted that geometrically similar animals would swim at the same speed with stroke frequency scaling with mass. In the present study, morphological and behavioural data obtained from free-ranging penguins (seven species) were compared. Morphological measurements support the geometrical similarity. However, cruising speeds of 1.8{\^{a}}€“2.3 m s were significantly related to mass and stroke frequencies were proportional to mass. These scaling relationships do not agree with the previous predictions for geometrically similar animals. We propose a theoretical model, considering metabolic cost, work against mechanical forces (drag and buoyancy), pitch angle and dive depth. This new model predicts that: (i) the optimal swim speed, which minimizes the energy cost of transport, is proportional to (basal metabolic rate/drag) independent of buoyancy, pitch angle and dive depth; (ii) the optimal speed is related to mass; and (iii) stroke frequency is proportional to mass. The observed scaling relationships of penguins support these predictions, which suggest that breath-hold divers swam optimally to minimize the cost of transport, including mechanical and metabolic energy during dive.},

abstract = {Early and modern theories of the origin of ambergris are described. Ambergris occurs in both male and female sperm whales, and also in the pygmy sperm whale. It occurs in about one in 100 sperm whales. The largest find weighed 455kg and sold for {\pounds}23,000 in 1914. Ambergris occurs in the rectum of the whale but neither causes nor betrays disease. The rectum is not damaged by squid beaks. Indigestible material, that is, squid beaks and pens and the cuticles of parasitic nematode worms, are regularly vomited by sperm whales and the intestine and rectum can only deal with liquid faeces. When, as sometimes happens, some indigestible material leaks into the intestine and, by at least partly blocking the flow of the faeces, the tangled mass is pushed into the rectum where there is reason to believe that the water absorbing capacity of the rectum is increased (p. 33). In this way the faecal matter is precipitated on the indigestible material to form a smooth concretion and the faeces can pass again. Then more foecal material arrives and the process is repeated. In this way the flow of liquid faeces is maintained, although at the expense of accretionary growth in size of the coprolith which becomes ambergris. Response processes in the whale are constructional. The biochemical processes which transform the coprolith into ambergris are consequential upon its incubation over a long period in the peculiar environment of the rectum teeming with bacteria. Eventually the rectum stretches until it breaks, causing the whale's death and the ambergris is released into the sea.},

abstract = {Toothed whales emit high-powered ultrasonic clicks to echolocate a wide range of prey. It may be hypothesized that some of their prey species have evolved capabilities to detect and respond to such ultrasonic pulses in a way that reduces predation, akin to the situation for many nocturnal insects and echolocating bats. Using high-speed film recordings and controlled exposures, we obtained behavioural evidence that simulated toothed whale biosonar clicks elicit highly directional anti-predator responses in an ultrasound-sensitive allis shad (Alosa alosa). Ten shad were exposed to 192 dB re. 1 $\mu$Pa (pp) clicks centred at 40 kHz at repetition rates of 1, 20, 50 and 250 clicks s(-1) with summed energy flux density levels of 148, 161, 165 and 172 dB re. 1 $\mu$Pa(2) s. The exposures mimicked the acoustic exposure from a delphinid toothed whale in different phases of prey search and capture. The response times of allis shad were faster for higher repetition rates of clicks with the same sound pressure level. None of the fish responded to a single click, but had median response times of 182, 93 and 57 ms when exposed to click rates of 20, 50 and 250 clicks s(-1), respectively. This suggests that the ultrasound detector of allis shad is an energy detector and that shad respond faster when exposed to a nearby fast-clicking toothed whale than to a slow-clicking toothed whale far away. The findings are thus consistent with the hypothesis that shad ultrasound detection is used for reducing predation from echolocating toothed whales.},

abstract = {Interactions within and between species complicate quantification of climate effects, by causing indirect, often delayed, effects of climate fluctuations and compensation of mortality. Here we identify direct and indirect climate effects by analysing unique Russian time-series data from the Norwegian Sea{\^{a}}€“Barents Sea ecosystem on the first life stages of cod, capelin, herring and haddock, their predators, competitors and zooplanktonic prey. By analysing growth and survival from one life stage to the next (eggs{\^{a}}€“larvae{\^{a}}€“juveniles{\^{a}}€“recruits), we find evidence for both bottom-up, direct and top-down effects of climate. Ambient zooplankton biomass predicts survival of all species, whereas ambient temperature mainly affects survival through effects on growth. In warm years, all species experienced improved growth and feeding conditions. Cohorts born following a warm year will, however, experience increased predation and competition because of increased densities of subadult cod and herring, leading to delayed climate effects. While climate thus affects early growth and survival through several mechanisms, only some of the identified mechanisms were found to be significant predictors of population growth. In particular, our findings exemplify that climate impacts are barely propagated to later life stages when density dependence is strong.},

Two predictions were tested: (1) these vocalizations should be individually-distinct (stereotyped) in females and pups of both species if they serve to function for recognition, and (2) because individuality should be more pronounced in a species where separations and reunions are common, the vocalizations used between northern fur seal mother-offspring pairs should be more individually-stereotyped than those of the northern elephant seal. Principal components analyses revealed structural differences between the calls of females and pups in both species. Analysis of variance showed the calls of individual seals to be acoustically distinct in all cases. The calls used between mother-offspring pairs of northern fur seals were more stereotyped than those of northern elephant seals. These calls had less within-individual variation, greater among-individual variation and were more often correctly predicted in discriminant analyses. The results indicate that selective pressure to develop vocal recognition exists in both species but is greater in the northern fur seal.},

A total of 11029 vocalisations recorded throughout and immediately after the breeding season were analysed. Vocalisations were classified by cluster analysis techniques, based on differences in frequency, duration, call shape, waveform and number of elements. Thirteen broad call categories (many with subdivisions) were identified. Twelve call types (belonging to nine categories) made up 91.9{\%} of the vocalisations and were present at an seven study sites within the Vestfold Hills, and a single site at the Larsemann Hills approximately 150 km away. A further eight call types (five categories) made up another 6.7{\%} of the vocalisations. These were not detected at every recording site. An additional 29 call types (11 categories) were infrequent and probably reflect the diversity of individual seals. This study strengthens the case for macrogeographic variation in underwater Weddell seal vocalisations around Antarctica. Microgeographic differences, between sites within 150 km, were weak and not consistent between sites or years. Some adult females move to different breeding sites within the Vestfold Hills area between years. This would probably preclude the establishment of site specific (microgeographic) repertoire differences.},

The similarities between the acoustic properties of underwater tail slaps recorded from killer whales in Norway, and thud-like sounds recorded from killer whales in Iceland suggest that Norwegian and Icelandic killer whales use similar hunting techniques. The acoustic characteristics of sounds produced by underwater tail slaps were similar to the ones from other cavitation sound sources described in the literature, both in term of temporal and frequency features as well as in source level. We suggest that multiple factors generated by the tail slaps like particle fluctuations, turbulence, pressure changes and physical impact cause debilitation of herring.},

abstract = {The iron-limited Southern Ocean plays an important role in regulating atmospheric CO2 levels. Marine mammal respiration has been proposed to decrease the efficiency of the Southern Ocean biological pump by returning photosynthetically fixed carbon to the atmosphere. Here, we show that by consuming prey at depth and defecating iron-rich liquid faeces into the photic zone, sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) instead stimulate new primary production and carbon export to the deep ocean. We estimate that Southern Ocean sperm whales defecate 50 tonnes of iron into the photic zone each year. Molar ratios of Cexport {\^{a}}ˆ{\P}Feadded determined during natural ocean fertilization events are used to estimate the amount of carbon exported to the deep ocean in response to the iron defecated by sperm whales. We find that Southern Ocean sperm whales stimulate the export of 4 {\~{A}}— 105 tonnes of carbon per year to the deep ocean and respire only 2 {\~{A}}— 105{\^{A}} tonnes of carbon per year. By enhancing new primary production, the populations of 12 000 sperm whales in the Southern Ocean act as a carbon sink, removing 2 {\~{A}}— 105 tonnes more carbon from the atmosphere than they add during respiration. The ability of the Southern Ocean to act as a carbon sink may have been diminished by large-scale removal of sperm whales during industrial whaling.},

Pups may suckle for 2 yr prior to weaning and females were recorded suckling both a yearling and a 2-yr-old pup. N, cinerea is positively thigmotropic. Ambient temperature affects daily distribution and movements on land. They normally fear humans but local populations can develop a surprising degree of tameness. Adults commonly reach 8 or 9 yr of age.},

abstract = {Abstract  Sea turtle populations worldwide suffer from reduced survival of immatures and adults due to fishery bycatch. Unfortunately, information about the whereabouts of turtles outside the breeding habitat is scarce in most areas, hampering the development of spatially explicit conservation plans. In the Mediterranean, recoveries of adult females flipper-tagged on nesting beaches suggest that the Adriatic Sea and Gulf of Gab{\`{e}}s are important foraging areas for adults, but such information could be heavily biased (observing and reporting bias). In order to obtain unbiased data, we satellite-tracked seven loggerhead sea turtles after they completed nesting in the largest known Mediterranean rookery (Bay of Laganas, Zakynthos, Greece). Three females settled in the north Adriatic Sea, one in the south Adriatic Sea and two in the Gulf of Gab{\`{e}}s area at the completion of their post-nesting migrations (one individual did not occupy a distinct foraging area). The concordance of tracking results with information from recoveries of flipper-tagged turtles suggests that the north Adriatic Sea and the Gulf of Gab{\`{e}}s represent key areas for female adult Mediterranean loggerhead sea turtles.},

abstract = {Late-term fetal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are bent ventrolaterally en utero, requiring extreme flexibility of the axial skeleton and associated soft tissues. At birth, neonatal dolphins must immediately swim to the surface to breath, yet the dorsoventral oscillations used during locomotion may be compromised by the lateral flexibility evident in the fetus. The unique fetal position of dolphins, coupled with their need to swim at birth, places conflicting mechanical demands on the tailstock. Our previous research demonstrated that neonatal dolphins possess laterally placed, axial muscles that are functionally specialized to actively maintain the straightened posture of the tailstock. Here, we investigated the development of passive lateral stability in the tailstock of bottlenose dolphins by performing whole-body bending tests on an ontogenetic series of stranded dolphin specimens (N=15), including fetuses, neonates and juveniles (total length 58-171 cm). Structural stiffness increased, while overall body curvature decreased, with increasing body length. Scaling analyses suggest that increased structural stiffness is due to increases in size and probably changes in the passive material properties of the tailstock through ontogeny. The neutral zone was approximately constant with increasing size, while the relative neutral zone (neutral zone/total length) decreased. The lateral stability of the tailstock appears to be controlled by a combination of active and passive systems and the role of these systems varies through ontogeny. While neonates use active, muscular mechanisms to limit lateral deformations of the tailstock, the stability of the maturing tailstock is due primarily to its passive tissue properties.},

abstract = {A severe scarcity of life history and population data for deep-water fishes is a major impediment to successful fisheries management. Long-term data for non-target species and those living deeper than the fishing grounds are particularly rare. We analysed a unique dataset of scientific trawls made from 1977 to 1989 and from 1997 to 2002, at depths from 800 to 4800{\^{a}}€{\v{S}}m. Over this time, overall fish abundance fell significantly at all depths from 800 to 2500{\^{a}}€{\v{S}}m, considerably deeper than the maximum depth of commercial fishing (approx. 1600{\^{a}}€{\v{S}}m). Changes in abundance were significantly larger in species whose ranges fell at least partly within fished depths and did not appear to be consistent with any natural factors such as changes in fluxes from the surface or the abundance of potential prey. If the observed decreases in abundance are due to fishing, then its effects now extend into the lower bathyal zone, resulting in declines in areas that have been previously thought to be unaffected. A possible mechanism is impacts on the shallow parts of the ranges of fish species, resulting in declines in abundance in the lower parts of their ranges. This unexpected phenomenon has important consequences for fisheries and marine reserve management, as this would indicate that the impacts of fisheries can be transmitted into deep offshore areas that are neither routinely monitored nor considered as part of the managed fishery areas.},

abstract = {Controlled feeding experiments were undertaken with captive Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) to assess seasonal (winter vs. summer) physiological responses of individual animals to reduced quantities and qualities of food that are hypothesised to occur in the wild. Eight animals were randomly divided into two experimental groups fed isocaloric diets: Group H ate Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) throughout the experiment while Group P was switched to walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) during a 28-day food restriction (after a 28-day baseline) and back to herring during a 28-day controlled re-feeding. Diet type did not impact the rates of body mass lost when food was restricted, but did influence the type of internal energy reserve (protein vs. lipids) the sea lions predominantly used. In both summer and winter, Group H lost significantly more lipids and less lean mass than Group P that was fed pollock during the restriction phase. The response of Group H was consistent with the predicted pattern of nutritional stress physiology (i.e. protein sparing and utilization of lipid reserves). Group P lost a surprisingly high proportion of body protein while consuming restricted levels of pollock, which could lead to muscle impairment and vital organ failure on a long-term basis. When given increased amounts of herring during the controlled re-feeding phase, the capacity of both groups to compensate for the previous mass loss was found to depend on season and was independent of previous diet. All of the sea lions increased their rates of mass gain and returned to their pre-experimental weight during winter, but not during summer. Some intrinsic energetic plasticity related to seasonal adaptation to the environment may render winter an easier period than summer to recover from nutritional stress.},

Am. 108, 1327-1331 (2000)] is applied to the case of icebreakers affecting beluga whales in the Beaufort Sea. Two types of noise emitted by the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker Henry Larsen are analyzed: bubbler system noise and propeller cavitation noise. Effects on beluga whales are modeled both in a deep-water environment and a near-shore environment. The model estimates that the Henry Larsen is audible to beluga whales over ranges of 35-78 km, depending on location. The zone of behavioral disturbance is only slightly smaller. Masking of beluga communication signals is predicted within 14-71-km range. Temporary hearing damage can occur if a beluga stays within 1-4 km of the Henry Larsen for at least 20 min. Bubbler noise impacts over the short ranges quoted; propeller cavitation noise accounts for all the long-range effects. Serious problems can arise in heavily industrialized areas where animals are exposed to ongoing noise and where anthropogenic noise from a variety of sources adds up.},

We examined individual and geographical variation in the vocal and dive behaviour of male harbour seals, Phoca vitulina, which is associated with aquatic mating. This display behaviour was recorded in the Moray Firth, Scotland, from July 1994 to 1997, and in Orkney, Scotland, during July 1998. One vocalization type was apparent in the Moray Firth and two in Orkney. Time parameters (total and pulse duration) varied between males in the population in the Moray Firth. We used both frequency and time parameters in a discriminant analysis, which showed that 73.2{\%} of individual male vocalizations could be correctly classified; 94.6{\%} of male vocalizations from the Moray Firth and Orkney could be correctly classified according to their geographical areas. Therefore, vocal variation was greater between geographical areas than between individuals. No individual variation was apparent between dive and surface interval durations. However, individuals varied significantly in the percentage of short surface intervals. Male harbour seals showed substantial variability in the parameters affecting their vocal and dive behaviour during the mating season. We suggest that these variations may be indicative of adaptations to varying environmental challenges influencing the reproductive strategies of discrete populations.

abstract = {1. Evoked slow potentials were recorded extracellularly from the mid-brains of snakes of the genus Crotalus. For the auditory and somatic systems, amplitude, latency, and duration of responses were studied as the parameters of intensity, frequency, and rise time of sinusoidal vibratory or click stimuli were varied. Recovery curves were constructed for paired stimuli and for trains. Effects of body temperature on frequency-response threshold curves were determined. Results were verified for species of the families Boidae and Colubridae.2. Intensity-amplitude curves increase logarithmically for c. 20 dB above threshold and then reach a plateau for the auditory system. These curves are generally increasing over a 40 dB range in the somatic system. Latency decreases monotonically with increasing intensity; it is independent of frequency for the auditory system but depends on frequency for the somatic system.3. Differences in shape of intensity-amplitude curves for different frequencies lead to the hypothesis that there are auditory units with different frequency-response curves. This finding is relevant to the study of the evolution of audition. Differences in intensity-amplitude curves for the somatic system and differences in latencies for different frequencies suggest that several types of somatic vibration receptors contribute to the central response.4. Increase in body temperature causes increase in the frequency of greatest sensitivity for the auditory system, and increases sensitivity by 1-3 dB per {\{}degrees{\}}C. Higher frequencies are affected more than lower frequencies. The somatic system sensitivity is increased by c. 1.5 dB per {\{}degrees{\}}C, except at the extremes of the frequency curve. These findings emphasize the importance of studying effects of temperature on the central nervous systems of cold-blooded vertebrates.5. Of relevance to the biology of snakes is the observation that snakes are not well suited, at the mid-brain level, for rapid analysis of sequential vibratory events. A principle of general biological significance supported by comparison of temporal characteristics of mid-brain responses of snakes and other animals is that latency and recovery are related to auditory specialization rather than to phylogeny.},

abstract = {Studies have reported important effects of recent climate change on Antarctic species, but there has been to our knowledge no attempt to explicitly link those results to forecasted population responses to climate change. Antarctic sea ice extent (SIE) is projected to shrink as concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) increase, and emperor penguins () are extremely sensitive to these changes because they use sea ice as a breeding, foraging and molting habitat. We project emperor penguin population responses to future sea ice changes, using a stochastic population model that combines a unique long-term demographic dataset (1962{\^{a}}€“2005) from a colony in Terre Ad{\~{A}}{\textcopyright}lie, Antarctica and projections of SIE from General Circulation Models (GCM) of Earth's climate included in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report. We show that the increased frequency of warm events associated with projected decreases in SIE will reduce the population viability. The probability of quasi-extinction (a decline of 95{\%} or more) is at least 36{\%} by 2100. The median population size is projected to decline from {\^{a}}‰ˆ6,000 to {\^{a}}‰ˆ400 breeding pairs over this period. To avoid extinction, emperor penguins will have to adapt, migrate or change the timing of their growth stages. However, given the future projected increases in GHGs and its effect on Antarctic climate, evolution or migration seem unlikely for such long lived species at the remote southern end of the Earth.},

abstract = {Humpback whale song, a male breeding display, shows a remarkable degree of similarity among distant breeding assemblages, despite constant progressive change. It has been hypothesized that whales maintain continuity through cultural transmission via migratory movements of males. We examined songs of whales breeding off Hawaii and Mexico to determine whether they changed similarly in both areas during the course of a breeding season. Songs recorded off Kauai, Hawaii (11 individuals) and Isla Socorro, Mexico (13 individuals) during winter and spring of 1991, were compared qualitatively and quantitatively. We measured 44 acoustic variables describing all known levels of song structure for each singer and we grouped these variables into six categories. We used two-factor analyses of variance to assess change across the season in each area, comparing the two regions and two 3-week periods (January/February and April). Twenty-seven variables changed significantly during the 12-week study in at least one area. Variables within categories displayed similar trends of change. Time and frequency characteristics describing the structure of song elements (units and phrases) changed synchronously in each area, with 21 of 25 variables displaying significant differences between periods and no interaction with region. Structures of song patterns, as defined by frequency of occurrence and number of unit and phrase types, changed differently in each area, with five of 12 variables indicating a significant interaction between region and period. Our results may suggest cultural transmission during the season, since many variables changed in similar manners. We propose an alternative hypothesis, that whales may be predisposed to gradually change certain features of song independently of cultural influences; change of structural elements may be governed by a discrete set of rules, or according to an innate template. Therefore, continuity of song patterns across the ocean basin may be due to a combination of mechanisms, only partially involving cultural transmission. We assess these hypotheses in relation to humpback whale behaviour and population structure, and cultural transmission and evolution of avian song.},

abstract = {Quantification of prey consumption by marine predators is key to understanding the organisation of ecosystems. This especially concerns penguins, which are major consumers of southern food webs. As direct observation of their feeding activity is not possible, several indirect methods have been developed that take advantage of miniaturised data logging technology, most commonly: detection of (i) anomalies in diving profiles (wiggles), (ii) drops in oesophageal temperature and (iii) the opening of mouth parts (recorded with a Hall sensor). In the present study, we used these three techniques to compare their validity and obtain information about the feeding activity of two free-ranging king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus). Crucially, and for the first time, two types of beak-opening events were identified. Type A was believed to correspond to failed prey-capture attempts and type B to successful attempts, because, in nearly all cases, only type B was followed by a drop in oesophageal temperature. The number of beak-opening events, oesophageal temperature drops and wiggles per dive were all correlated. However, for a given dive, the number of wiggles and oesophageal temperature drops were lower than the number of beak-opening events. Our results suggest that recording beak opening is a very accurate method for detecting prey ingestions by diving seabirds at a fine scale. However, these advantages are counterbalanced by the difficulty, and hence potential adverse effects, of instrumenting birds with the necessary sensor/magnet, which is in contrast to the less accurate but more practicable methods of measuring dive profiles or, to a lesser extent, oesophageal temperature.},

abstract = {Two sperm whales tagged with acoustic transponder tags were tracked by sonar during a cruise from 16 to 30 October 1991 in the southeast Caribbean west of Dominica Island. The whales dove to depths of 4002013600 m and more, including a dive to 1,185 m and one possibly to 2,000 m. They were tracked for periods of 3201314 h, over distances of 8.5201340 km. The tagged whales were found together four and eight days after tagging, and were tracked simultaneously for 13 h, over 31 km. Whale movements on different days at the surface averaged from 0.68 to 0.82 m/set, with dive descent rates from 0.82 to 1.13 m/set, ascent rates from 0.74 to 1.16 m/set, and horizontal movement during dives from 0.76 to 1.29 m/set. Dives lasted from 18 min to 1 h and 13 min, averaging 33 and 41 min on different days. Every track ended when tag signals became obscured at night by dense biological scatterers concentrated in offshore areas where the whales were diving. Both tagged whales appear to have been males of 15 and 11m, each dominant in different groups; but when together the larger whale was dominant, as evidenced by chases and agonistic vocalizations. The whales did not appear to react to the tags or to the sounds associated with tracking (30, 32, and 36 kHz).},

abstract = {Subantarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus tropicalis, come ashore to breed in dense colonies and lactating females have to alternate foraging trips at sea with periods ashore during which they suckle their pups. The effectiveness of vocal recognition between mothers and pups, has been shown experimentally. To see whether the recognition abilities of females differ from those of their offspring, we investigated how pups recognize their mother's calls. We used artificially modified signals in playback experiments to determine which acoustic parameters support the recognition process. Pups used both the energy spectrum and the ascending frequency modulation occurring at the beginning of each call. However, they seemed to rely mainly on spectral analyses. The vocal identification process at a perceptual level is therefore asymmetrical, as mothers mainly use temporal structures to recognize their pup's calls.

abstract = {Marine turtles spend more than 90{\%} of their life underwater and have been termed surfacers as opposed to divers. Nonetheless turtles have been reported occasionally to float motionless at the surface but the reasons for this behaviour are not clear. We investigated the location, timing and duration of extended surface times (ESTs) in 10 free-ranging loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) and the possible relationship to water temperature and diving activity recorded via satellite relay data loggers for 101-450 days. For one turtle that dived only in offshore areas, ESTs contributed 12{\%} of the time whereas for the other turtles ESTs contributed 0.4-1.8{\%} of the time. ESTs lasted on average 90 min but were mostly infrequent and irregular, excluding the involvement of a fundamental regulatory function. However, 82{\%} of the ESTs occurred during daylight, mostly around noon, suggesting a dependence on solar radiation. For three turtles, there was an appreciable (7{\{}degrees{\}}C to 10.5{\{}degrees{\}}C) temperature decrease with depth for dives during periods when ESTs occurred frequently, suggesting a re-warming function of EST to compensate for decreased body temperatures, possibly to enhance digestive efficiency. A positive correlation between body mass and EST duration supported this explanation. By contrast, night-active turtles that exceeded their calculated aerobic dive limits in 7.6-16{\%} of the dives engaged in nocturnal ESTs, probably for lactate clearance. This is the first evidence that loggerhead turtles may refrain from diving for at least two reasons, either to absorb solar radiation or to recover from anaerobic activity.},

The brain of P. phocoena is substantially more mature throughout development than that of L. obliquidens, and brain-growth patterns are related generally to adult encephalization levels in these two species.

abstract = {Studies of aquatic mating tactics in long-lived mammals are rare because of the difficulties involved in gaining repeated information on individuals over multiple years. We used acoustic array recordings as a tool for studying the mating tactics of bearded seals over 16 years off Point Barrow, Alaska. Males produce underwater vocalizations during the mating season that show clear individual differences. The most commonly used trill types, AL4 and AL1i, were analysed over 6 years (1985-1986, 1992-1993, 2000-2001). For each vocalization, we measured 17 parameters and determined an X, Y location through cross-correlation analysis. Classification trees showed that 100 individuals were present over the study period (22-40 males per year). Individuals showed clear site fidelity with 13-25 males returning over consecutive years. Six males were present over the entire 16-year period. Kernel home ranges were 0.32-3.2 km2 for 34 territorial males and 5.3-16.3 km2 for 66 roaming males. Throughout this study all but two males used the same mating tactic. When these males switched tactic (from territorial to roaming), the duration of their calls also changed, while all other acoustic variables remained constant. The vocal parameters for all the other males remained stable throughout their tenure. It appears therefore that although males can alter their mating tactics as circumstances change, only a few do so. Instead mating tactics tend to show long-term stability in vocal characteristics, strong site fidelity and periods of tenure that cover a significant proportion of the male's adult life span.},

abstract = {It has been established that some dolphins possess well-developed acoustic orientation (echolocation) and information gathering abilities, though substantially less is known about the system of sound generation and beam formation. Dolphins use a narrowly focused sound beam that emanates from the forehead and rostrum during echolocation. The primary objectives of this study were to simulate the effects of anatomical structure on beam formation, and to test the viability of various hypothetical sound source locations. Outlines from parasagittal x-ray CT scans were used to construct a 2-D model of the head of the common dolphin, Delphinus delphis. Finite difference techniques were used to simulate sound propagation through tissues modeled as inhomogeneous fluids. Preliminary simulations confirm that beam formation results primarily from reflection off of the skull and the skull-supported air sac surfaces. For the frequencies tested, beam angles best approximate those measured by experimental methods for a source located in a region of the model referred to as the monkey lip/dorsal bursae (MLDB) complex. The results suggest that: (1) the skull and air sacs play the central role in beam formation; (2) the geometry of reflective tissue is more important than the exact acoustical properties assigned; (3) a melon velocity profile of the magnitude tested is capable of mild focusing effects; and (4) experimentally observed beam patterns are best approximated at all frequencies simulated when the sound source is placed in the vicinity of the MLDB complex.},

abstract = {Airborne vocalizations play an important role in the communication system involved in the establishment and maintenance of social organization of breeding California sea lions. The vocalizations of adult males relate primarily to territorial behaviour and social status. They have only a single major type of vocalization, the bark, but vary its rhythm, repetition, loudness, and direction according to social context. Immature males employ an adult-type bark during play. The vocalizations of adult females relate to aggressive behaviour and mother-infant interactions. They use a bark, but somewhat higher in pitch than that of the males, as a mild threat, and employ harsh and noisy squeals, belches, and growls during more vigorous short-range altercations. The females have a loud, highly directional, bawling vocalization, the pup-attraction call which helps mother and pup to locate each other. Pups have mother-response calls which serve the same function. Both the pup-attraction and mother-response calls vary markedly from individual to individual, which presumably facilitates individual identification. The first vocalization of the pup is a bleat, which is used as both an alarm call and a threat. By the age of six weeks the pups begin to modify the bleat into a bark. The amphibious mode of life appears to have imposed conditions that have made pinnipeds especially dependent upon acoustic communication for maintenance of social organization while on land. A tabulation of the inferred information content of the calls and their acoustic properties suggests several correlations between functions of a vocalization and its physical structure. The ontogeny of the vocalizations shows little evidence that learning is important in acquisition of the basic repertoire.},

We show that each population of lyrebirds faithfully reproduces the song of the local population of bowerbirds. Within a population, lyrebirds show less variation in song structure than the available variation in the songs of the models.

Most fishes living there have pelagic larvae using the rich waters of the upper 200{\^{a}}€{\v{S}}m. Morphological and behavioural specializations necessary to occupy such contrasting environments have resulted in remarkable developmental changes and life-history strategies. We resolve a long-standing biological and taxonomic conundrum by documenting the most extreme example of ontogenetic metamorphoses and sexual dimorphism in vertebrates. Based on morphology and mitogenomic sequence data, we show that fishes currently assigned to three families with greatly differing morphologies, Mirapinnidae (tapetails), Megalomycteridae (bignose fishes) and Cetomimidae (whalefishes), are larvae, males and females, respectively, of a single family Cetomimidae. Morphological transformations involve dramatic changes in the skeleton, most spectacularly in the head, and are correlated with distinctly different feeding mechanisms. Larvae have small, upturned mouths and gorge on copepods. Females have huge gapes with long, horizontal jaws and specialized gill arches allowing them to capture larger prey. Males cease feeding, lose their stomach and oesophagus, and apparently convert the energy from the bolus of copepods found in all transforming males to a massive liver that supports them throughout adult life.},

abstract = {Life-history strategies describe that  slow'- in contrast to  fast'-living species allocate resources cautiously towards reproduction to enhance survival. Recent evidence suggests that variation in strategies exists not only among species but also among populations of the same species. Here, we examined the effect of experimentally induced stress on resource allocation of breeding seabirds in two populations with contrasting life-history strategies: slow-living Pacific and fast-living Atlantic black-legged kittiwakes. We tested the hypothesis that reproductive responses in kittiwakes under stress reflect their life-history strategies. We predicted that in response to stress, Pacific kittiwakes reduce investment in reproduction compared with Atlantic kittiwakes. We exposed chick-rearing kittiwakes to a short-term (3-day) period of increased exogenous corticosterone (CORT), a hormone that is released during food shortages. We examined changes in baseline CORT levels, parental care and effects on offspring. We found that kittiwakes from the two populations invested differently in offspring when facing stress. In response to elevated CORT, Pacific kittiwakes reduced nest attendance and deserted offspring more readily than Atlantic kittiwakes. We observed lower chick growth, a higher stress response in offspring and lower reproductive success in response to CORT implantation in Pacific kittiwakes, whereas the opposite occurred in the Atlantic. Our findings support the hypothesis that life-history strategies predict short-term responses of individuals to stress within a species. We conclude that behaviour and physiology under stress are consistent with trade-off priorities as predicted by life-history theory. We encourage future studies to consider the pivotal role of life-history strategies when interpreting inter-population differences of animal responses to stressful environmental events.},

abstract = {On encountering a predator, many species emit potentially risky vocalizations known as alarm calls. We evaluated the relative importance of two adaptive hypotheses on the evolution of calling: (1) communicating to predators, which may function by deterring pursuit and hence increasing individual survival, and (2) an alternative nepotistic hypothesis for alarm calling whereby callers obtain direct and indirect fitness by warning relatives. Focusing on 209 species of rodents, we found significant associations between diurnality and alarm calling, living socially and alarm calling, and diurnality and sociality. Diurnality, however, accounted for nearly three times as much variation in whether or not a species alarm called than did sociality. Phylogenetic tests revealed that the evolution of diurnality preceded the evolution of alarm calling, and that the evolutions of diurnality and sociality were unrelated. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that alarm communication evolved to communicate to predators. If so, then nepotistic benefits, although important for the maintenance of alarm calling in some rodents, may be relatively less important in its evolution.},

Because odontocete echolocation signals are variable and the emitted click frequency greatly affects the echolocation beam shape, investigations of beam focusing must account for frequency-related beam changes. In this study we tested whether the echolocation beam of a false killer whale changed depending on target difficulty and distance while also accounting for frequency-related changes in the echolocation beam. The data indicate that the false killer whale changes its beam size according to target distance and difficulty, which may be a strategy of maximizing the energy of the target echo. We propose that the animal is using a strategy of changing the focal region according to target distance and that this strategy is under active control.},

These results demonstrated ultrasonic hearing by shad, but thresholds at lower frequencies were potentially masked by background noise in the experimental room. In this study, the thresholds of the American shad in a quieter and smaller tank, as well as thresholds for detecting stimulated echolocation sounds of bottlenosed dolphins was determined. Shad had lower thresholds for detection (from 0.2 to 0.8 kHz) in the quieter and smaller tank compared with the previous experiment, with low-frequency background noise but similar thresholds at ultrasonic frequencies. Shad were also able to detect echolocation clicks with a threshold of 171 dB re: 1 microPa peak to peak. If spherical spreading and an absorption coefficient of 0.02 dB/m of dolphin echolocation clicks are assumed, shad should be able to detect echolocating Tursiops truncatus at ranges up to 187 m. The authors propose that ultrasonic hearing evolved in shad in response to selection pressures from echolocating odontocete cetaceans.},

The animals were trained to associate sound stimuli with a weak electric shock, and the recorded conditioned responses were changes in breathing and jetting activity. Five specimens of Sepia officinalis were tested, and all responded to these low frequency sounds. The relevant stimulus parameter was particle motion rather than sound pressure. The threshold values (measured as particle acceleration) decreased towards lower frequencies in the tested range, reaching values below 4 × 10-3 m/s2. The thresholds in the most sensitive range may have been masked by the considerable background noise at the experimental site (Naples). Two individuals of Octopus vulgaris and one Loligo vulgaris were also tested, and showed a similar sensitivity to low frequency sound.},

abstract = {North Atlantic right whales are critically endangered and, despite international protection from whaling, significant numbers die from collisions with ships. Large groups of right whales migrate to the coastal waters of New England during the late winter and early spring to feed in an area with large numbers of vessels. North Atlantic right whales have the largest per capita record of vessel strikes of any large whale population in the world. Right whale feeding behaviour in Cape Cod Bay (CCB) probably contributes to risk of collisions with ships. In this study, feeding right whales tagged with archival suction cup tags spent the majority of their time just below the water's surface where they cannot be seen but are shallow enough to be vulnerable to ship strike. Habitat surveys show that large patches of right whale prey are common in the upper 5 m of the water column in CCB during spring. These results indicate that the typical spring-time foraging ecology of right whales may contribute to their high level of mortality from vessel collisions. The results of this study suggest that remote acoustic detection of prey aggregations may be a useful supplement to the management and conservation of right whales.},

Reproduction was strictly seasonal, with ovulation, conception, and parturition occurring in the spring and early summer. The oldest specimen in the sample was 17 yr of age, but most individuals were younger than 12. The findings are similar to those of earlier studies from the Bay of Fundy and support the hypothesis that these animals form a single population. Harbor porpoises represent one end of a continuum of odontocete life histories that spans a wide diversity of strategies. In comparison with other, large odontocetes, harbor porpoises mature at an earlier age, reproduce more frequently, and live for shorter periods.},

abstract = {Among anuran amphibians, only two species, Odorrana tormota and Huia cavitympanum, are known to possess recessed tympanic membranes. Odorrana tormota is the first non-mammalian vertebrate demonstrated to communicate with ultrasonic frequencies (above 20 kHz), and the frogs' sunken tympana are hypothesized to play a key role in their high-frequency hearing sensitivity. Here we present the first data on the vocalizations of H. cavitympanum. We found that this species emits extraordinarily high-frequency calls, a portion of which are comprised entirely of ultrasound. This represents the first documentation of an anuran species producing purely ultrasonic signals. In addition, the vocal repertoire of H. cavitympanum is highly variable in frequency modulation pattern and spectral composition. The frogs' use of vocal signals with a wide range of dominant frequencies may be a strategy to maximize acoustic energy transmission to both nearby and distant receivers. The convergence of these species' call characteristics should stimulate additional, phylogenetically based studies of other lower vertebrates to provide new insight into the mechanistic and evolutionary foundations of high-frequency hearing in all vertebrate forms.},

abstract = {Evoked potential audiograms were measured in 13 Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus gilli) to determine the variability in hearing sensitivity and range of hearing. The auditory evoked potential system used a transducer embedded in a suction cup to deliver sinusoidal amplitude modulated tones to each dolphin through the pan region of the lower right jaw. Evoked potentials were recorded noninvasively using surface electrodes, and hearing thresholds were estimated by tracking the amplitude of the envelope following response, an evoked potential that is phase-locked to the stimulus modulation rate. Frequencies tested ranged from 10 to 180 kHz in each animal. Variability in the range of hearing and age-related reductions in hearing sensitivity and range of hearing were consistent with those observed in Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. Comparison of audiograms to a captive population of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins demonstrated that the Pacific bottlenose dolphins tested in this study had significantly lower thresholds at frequencies of 40 and 602013115 kHz. Differences in thresholds between the groups are unlikely to be due to methodological factors.},

abstract = {The possible structural relation between species-specificity and interspecific mimicry has been investigated in European starling's song. Mimicries have been recorded in several populations in Europe and in New Zealand. Previous studies of starling's song have shown that two basic categories, one composed of simple and loud songs (whistles), the other of long quiet and complex songs (warbles) can be recognized in the repertoires of all male starlings. Mimicries can be found in both contexts: in a loud and isolated way or included in warbling sequences. In Europe, about a third of the whistles are mimicries in an individual repertoire. Within a colony, the types of mimicries are individual-specific, but the same loud mimicries can be heard in different colonies. The loud mimicries are characterized by a high homogeneity amongst populations: half of those recorded in different countries in Europe correspond to the same 4 models (blackbird, little owl, buzzard, oriole). This does not reflect the abundance of the species in the environment and suggests a very strong selectivity. Results are totally different for the warbling in which most mimicries are unique to one starling and mainly reflect the sound environment. Little overlap is found between warbled and loud mimicries. Both in Europe and New Zealand, loud mimicries tend to have a simple whistled structure whereas the warbled ones most often include trills and several varied notes. Structural relations could be found between the species-specific whistled themes and the types of loud mimicries. Similarly quiet mimicries are included in the characteristic organization of warbling. Therefore it is suggested that the starling possesses two types of "templates" in its species-specific song which are reflected in its mimicries with quite different degrees of selectivity. These two categories of mimicries may have evolved for functional reasons that are linked to the corresponding functions of the species-specific songs themselves.},

abstract = {Songbird males learn to sing their songs from an adult {\^{a}}€˜tutor{\^{a}}€™ early in life, much like human infants learn to speak. Similar to humans, in the songbird brain there are separate neural substrates for vocal production and for auditory memory. In adult songbirds, the caudal pallium, the avian equivalent of the auditory association cortex, has been proposed to contain the neural substrate of tutor song memory, while the song system is involved in song production as well as sensorimotor learning. If this hypothesis is correct, there should be neuronal activation in the caudal pallium, and not in the song system, while the young bird is hearing the tutor song. We found increased song-induced molecular neuronal activation, measured as the expression of an immediate early gene, in the caudal pallium of juvenile zebra finch males that were in the process of learning to sing their songs. No such activation was found in the song system. Molecular neuronal activation was significantly greater in response to tutor song than to novel song or silence in the medial part of the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM). In the caudomedial mesopallium, there was significantly greater molecular neuronal activation in response to tutor song than to silence. In addition, in the NCM there was a significant positive correlation between spontaneous molecular neuronal activation and the strength of song learning during sleep. These results suggest that the caudal pallium contains the neural substrate for tutor song memory, which is activated during sleep when the young bird is in the process of learning its song. The findings provide insight into the formation of auditory memories that guide vocal production learning, a process fundamental for human speech acquisition.},

Here we analyse a large, long-term data set of sightings of deep-water cetaceans from the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Seasonal and geographic changes in the diversity of these genera are well predicted by a convex function of sea-surface temperature peaking at c. 21 degrees C. Thus, diversity is highest at intermediate latitudes - an emerging general pattern for the pelagic ocean. When applied to a range of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change global change scenarios, the predicted response is a decline of cetacean diversity across the tropics and increases at higher latitudes. This suggests that deep-water oceanic communities that dominate {\textgreater} 60{\%} of the planet's surface may reorganize in response to ocean warming, with low-latitude losses of diversity and resilience.},

Asymptotic theory is presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases in which we assume independence, m-dependence and exchangeable correlation structures from each subject are discussed. Efficiency of the pioposecl estimators in two simple situations is considered. The approach is closely related to quasi-likelihood.},

Using recordings collected on a single day in January 2008, a standard seismological method for estimating earthquake location from single instruments, the three-component analysis, was used to estimate the relative azimuth, incidence angle, and horizontal range between each OBS and detected calls. A validation study using airgun shots, performed prior to the call analysis, indicated that the accuracy of the three-component analysis was satisfactory for this preliminary study. Point transect sampling using cue counts, a form of distance sampling, was then used to estimate the average probability of detecting a call via the array during the chosen day. This is a key step to estimating density or abundance of animals using passive acoustic data. The average probability of detection was estimated to be 0.313 (standard error: 0.033). However, fin whale density could not be estimated due to a lack of an appropriate estimate of cue (i.e., vocalization) rate. This study demonstrates the potential for using a sparse array of widely spaced, independently operating acoustic sensors, such as OBSs, for estimating cetacean density.},

abstract = {Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) depend on frequency-modulated whistles for many aspects of their social behavior, including group cohesion and recognition of familiar individuals. Vocalization amplitude and frequency influences communication range and may be shaped by many ecological and physiological factors including energetic costs. Here, a calibrated GPS-synchronized hydrophone array was used to record the whistles of bottlenose dolphins in a tropical shallow-water environment with high ambient noise levels. Acoustic localization techniques were used to estimate the source levels and energy content of individual whistles. Bottlenose dolphins produced whistles with mean source levels of 146.7 ± 6.2 dB re. 1 $\mu$Pa(RMS). These were lower than source levels estimated for a population inhabiting the quieter Moray Firth, indicating that dolphins do not necessarily compensate for the high noise levels found in noisy tropical habitats by increasing their source level. Combined with measured transmission loss and noise levels, these source levels provided estimated median communication ranges of 750 m and maximum communication ranges up to 5740 m. Whistles contained less than 17 mJ of acoustic energy, showing that the energetic cost of whistling is small compared to the high metabolic rate of these aquatic mammals, and unlikely to limit the vocal activity of toothed whales.},

abstract = {Sound characteristics and sound emitting structures of larval, juvenile and adult rock lobsters, Panulirus longipes (Milne Edwards) have been investigated. There is a linear correlation between carapace length and dimensions of the sound producing organ (number and size of plectrum ridges) as well as average duration of a single squeak. The number of pulses per 100 ms squeak, however, decreases asymptotically from 30 in larval forms to about 10 in mature adults. Behavioural changes accompany this process. The energy of a single pulse is distributed equally over the audio frequency range. The same is true for the [`]slow rattle' sound, produced by mandible-grinding during feeding or moments of extreme agitation. Any predator attacking a rock lobster, is likely to receive injuries from the outstretched, spiny antennae. It is concluded that the antennal sound, accompanying the rock lobsters defence, functions as a warning device aimed primarily at predators, which will learn to associate the sound of rock lobsters with the unpleasant experience of the sharp antennal spines.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Offshore pile driving, e.g. during wind farm construction, produces substantial noise emissions into the water column, which may harm marine mammals. Therefore, it is common practice to attempt to deter the mammals out of potential danger zones beforehand. Seal scarers are commonly used as a deterrent for harbour porpoises in spite of a lack of clear evidence in support of their effectiveness. We investigated the responses of harbour porpoises to a Lofitech seal scarer by conducting visual observations in conjunction with sound measurements. Porpoise sighting rates within 1 km of the seal scarer significantly decreased to only 1{\%} during seal scarer activity. During 22 trials, when the seal scarer was deployed between 300 m and 3.3 km distance, all observed porpoises always avoided the seal scarer within 1.9 km (translating to sound levels of ≥122 dB re 1 µParms), avoided the seal scarer half the time within 2.1 to 2.4 km (119 to 121 dB re 1 µParms) and never avoided the seal scarer at distances beyond 2.6 km (≤118 dB re 1 µParms). The closest observed approach distance of a porpoise to the activated seal scarer was 798 m (132 dB re 1 µParms). Thus, the deployment of a Lofitech seal scarer during offshore pile driving activities can greatly reduce the risk of acoustic traumata to harbour porpoises. However, danger zones and thus the necessary deterrence zones have to be calculated specifically for each project based on measurements of sound transmission in the area.},

Auditory sensitivity was measured using narrow-band, frequency-modulated signals (1500 ms duration) with center frequencies ranging from 0.125 to 15 kHz. The resulting underwater audiogram (50{\%} detection thresholds) for this individual walrus shows the typical mammalian U-shape. Maximum sensitivity (67 dB re 1 muPa) occur-red at 12 kHz. The range of best hearing (10 dB from the maximum sensitivity) was from I to 12 kHz. Sensitivity fell gradually below 1 kHz and dropped off sharply above 12 kHz. The animal showed a peculiar insensitivity for 2 kHz signals. His much higher sensitivity for 1.5- and 3-kHz signals indicated that this is a narrow-band phenomenon. Walrus hearing is relatively sensitive to low frequency sound, thus the species is likely to be susceptible to anthropogenic noise. The thresholds found during a small test with four frequencies with signal durations of 300 ms did not differ significantly from those obtained with signal durations of 1500 ms.

Carapid fishes produce sounds with a complex swimbladder mechanism, including skeletal components and extrinsic sonic muscle fibers with an exceptional helical myofibrillar structure. To study this system we stimulated the sonic muscles, described their insertion and action and generated sounds by slowly pulling the sonic muscles. We find the sonic muscles contract slowly, pulling the anterior bladder and thereby stretching a thin fenestra. Sound is generated when the tension trips a release system that causes the fenestra to snap back to its resting position. The sound frequency does not correspond to the calculated resonant frequency of the bladder, and we hypothesize that it is determined by the snapping fenestra interacting with an overlying bony swimbladder plate. To our knowledge this tension release mechanism is unique in animal sound generation.},

abstract = {Mixed-effect models are frequently used to control for the nonindependence of data points, for example, when repeated measures from the same individuals are available. The aim of these models is often to estimate fixed effects and to test their significance. This is usually done by including random intercepts, that is, intercepts that are allowed to vary between individuals. The widespread belief is that this controls for all types of pseudoreplication within individuals. Here we show that this is not the case, if the aim is to estimate effects that vary within individuals and individuals differ in their response to these effects. In these cases, random intercept models give overconfident estimates leading to conclusions that are not supported by the data. By allowing individuals to differ in the slopes of their responses, it is possible to account for the nonindependence of data points that pseudoreplicate slope information. Such random slope models give appropriate standard errors and are easily implemented in standard statistical software. Because random slope models are not always used where they are essential, we suspect that many published findings have too narrow confidence intervals and a substantially inflated type I error rate. Besides reducing type I errors, random slope models have the potential to reduce residual variance by accounting for between-individual variation in slopes, which makes it easier to detect treatment effects that are applied between individuals, hence reducing type II errors as well.},

abstract = {Individual vocal recognition between mothers and pups has been widely observed in pinnipeds, especially otariids. Otariids are colonial breeders; mothers suckle only their own offspring, aggressively attacking nonrelated young. Mothers alternate foraging trips with periods ashore, and at each return to the colony, mothers and pups must find each other among all the individuals of the colony. In the Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea), the need for a finely tuned mechanism of recognition is exacerbated by their habit of changing the nursing location over the course of lactation. We investigated potential acoustic parameters used in mother-pup recognition in Australian sea lions. We measured I I acoustic parameters on calls of mothers and pups and found that several parameters (fundamental frequency, energy spectrum, amplitude, and frequency modulation) were highly individually specific. Discriminant analysis correctly assigned calls to individual mothers or pups with an average classification rate of 65{\%} and 77{\%}, respectively. Spectral features and frequency modulation were the most important features distinguishing individuals. Lastly, principal component analysis showed that calls of pups and mothers were easily distinguishable using energy spectrum and frequency modulation. Comparison with other pinniped species suggests that individual vocal identity is likely to be selected through ecological constraints such as density of the colony, degree of polygyny, likelihood of allosuckling or fostering, and degree of maternal absence during lactation.},

The seismic sources, towed at a depth of 8 m, were alternatively fired every 25 m along 51 transects, each 51 525 m long, separated from adjacent transects by 500 m. The possible influence of this seismic activity on pelagic fish (herring, blue whiting and mesopelagic species) was investigated in two ways. First, the distribution and abundance within the seismic area and the surrounding waters up to 30-50 km away were mapped acoustically three times. In all three surveys the acoustic abundance of pelagic fish was higher outside than inside the seismic shooting area, indicating a long-term effect of the seismic activity. Secondly, the acoustic abundance was recorded directly prior to and after shooting along some of the seismic transects. In these comparisons no differences were found, indicating that the shooting had insignificant short-term scaring effects. However, both blue whiting and mesopelagic species were found in deeper waters in periods with shooting compared to periods without shooting, indicating that vertical movement rather than horizontal movement could be a short-term reaction to this noise.},

abstract = {The importance of predation and burrow digging in explaining the evolution of sociality is generally unclear. We focused on New World hystricognath rodents to evaluate three key predictions of the predation hypothesis. First, large-bodied surface-dwelling species will be more vulnerable because they are more detectable; thus sociality should be associated with body size. Second, surface-dwelling, diurnal species would be more vulnerable to predators than nocturnal species; thus sociality should be associated with the evolution of diurnality. Third, species living in open habitats will be more vulnerable; thus sociality should evolve in species living in open habitats. Regarding the importance of burrows, we tested if species that dig burrows can benefit from communal labor; thus, sociality should be associated with burrow digging. All traits had significant phylogenetic signal, thus comparative analyses should explicitly address this. In a comparative analysis on independent contrasts we found that sociality was correlated with body size (larger species were more social), diurnality (diurnal species were more social), and burrowing (burrowing species were more social), but we found no effect of overhead plant cover of habitat on sociality in hystricognath rodents. Somewhat different results were found when we analyzed the raw data. Taken together, our results provide support for a link between predation risk, burrow digging, and sociality in this group.},

abstract = {Fish-eating killer whales Orcinus orca in the northeastern Pacific live in highly stable matrifocal social groups called pods. Each pod produces a repertoire of seven or more stereotyped call types. We compared the relative production of call types of free-ranging killer whale pods over time and between social contexts. The relative production of call types by each pod during directional travel was distinct over a 27-yr period; however, both temporal stability and pod distinctiveness were strongly influenced by a subset of dominant call types within the repertoire of each pod. Some call types within the repertoires contain biphonation (two overlapping independently modulated tones) and have a higher estimated active space than call types containing just one tone. In multi-pod aggregations the relative production of the dominant call types of each pod decreased and the relative production of a subset of call types that are rarely recorded from single-pod groupings increased. The majority of these contained biphonation. The data suggest a distinction between a subset of dominant call types that may function to identify the pod and a subset of less common call types including several call types containing biphonation that are more commonly produced during inter-pod affiliations.},

Approximately 25-65 walruses frequented the polynya area each winter; their distribution was determined by sea-ice features (e.g., thin annual ice, cracks) that ensured easy access to open water. The mating system of walruses breeding in the area is best described as female-defense polygyny. A large mature male had exclusive access to a herd of walruses containing several females for 1-5 days at a time. Although two males spent significantly more time with a herd. It was not evident that female preference was important in determining which male became the attending male. When attending a herd, a male continuously repeated a complex, stereotyped underwater song. Other sexually mature males in the area behaved as silent herd members, vocal satellite males, or, in some cases, both. The small number of walruses at the polynya, the sedentary nature of the population due to ice conditions, and the inherent gregariousness of female walruses appear to be important factors influencing the evolution of social behavior and the mating system in walruses.},

We report the hearing abilities of a stranded juvenile beaked whale (Mesoplodon europaeus) measured with auditory evoked potentials. The beaked whale's modulation rate transfer function (MRTF) measured with a 40-kHz carrier showed responses up to an 1,800 Hz amplitude modulation (AM) rate. The MRTF was strongest at the 1,000 and 1,200 Hz AM rates. The envelope following response (EFR) input-output functions were non-linear. The beaked whale was most sensitive to high frequency signals between 40 and 80 kHz, but produced smaller evoked potentials to 5 kHz, the lowest frequency tested. The beaked whale hearing range and sensitivity are similar to other odontocetes that have been measured.},

abstract = {Cetacean mass stranding events associated with naval mid-frequency sonar use have raised considerable conservation concerns. These strandings have mostly involved beaked whales, with common pathologies, including "bubble lesions" similar to decompression sickness symptoms and acoustic traumas. However, other cetacean species have also stranded coincident with naval exercises. Possible mechanisms for the strandings include a behavioral response that causes deep divers to alter their diving behavior, which then results in decompression sickness-like impacts. Current mitigation measures during military exercises are focused on preventing auditory damage (hearing loss), but there are significant flaws with this approach. Behavioral responses, which occur at lower sound levels than those that cause hearing loss, may be more critical. Thus, mitigation measures should be revised. A growing number of international bodies recognize this issue and have urged increasing scrutiny of sound-producing activities, but many national jurisdictions have resisted calls for increased protection.},

abstract = {Hearing is attenuated in the aerial ear of humans and other land mammals tested in pressure chambers as a result of middle ear impedance changes that result from increased air density. We tested the hypothesis, based on recent middle ear models, that increasing the density of middle ear air at depth might attenuate whale hearing. Two white whales Delphinapterus leucas made dives to a platform at a depth of 5, 100, 200 or 300 m in the Pacific Ocean. During dives to station on the platform for up to 12 min, the whales whistled in response to 500 ms tones projected at random intervals to assess their hearing threshold at each depth. Analysis of response whistle spectra, whistle latency in response to tones and hearing thresholds showed that the increased hydrostatic pressure at depth changed each whale's whistle response at depth, but did not attenuate hearing overall. The finding that whale hearing is not attenuated at depth suggests that sound is conducted through the head tissues of the whale to the ear without requiring the usual ear drum/ossicular chain amplification of the aerial middle ear. These first ever hearing tests in the open ocean demonstrate that zones of audibility for human-made sounds are just as great throughout the depths to which these whales dive, or at least down to 300 m.},

To address this data gap, the contribution of 25 physical, biological and anthropogenic factors to the ambient noise levels in the Wilmington, North Carolina Intracoastal Waterway were analyzed using a principal components analysis and least squares regression. The total number of recreational vessels passing through the waterway per hour is the factor that had the single greatest influence on environmental noise levels. During times of high boat traffic, anthropogenic noise is continuous rather than episodic, and occurs at frequencies that are biologically relevant to bottlenose dolphins. As a daily part of resident bottlenose dolphins' acoustic environment, recreational boating traffic may represent a chronic source of acoustic harassment. (c) 2007 Acoustical Society of America.},

During the spring of 1999, playback experiments were conducted at eight locations in Elkhorn Slough, California, U.S.A. Through an underwater speaker, we presented male harbour seals with three acoustic stimuli: a long-duration, low-frequency roar (LL), a short-duration, high-frequency roar (SH) and amplified water noise (control). Male responses to the playback boat were characterized by increased approach rates and aggressive flipper slapping during 62.5{\%} of SH sessions (N = 8), 25{\%} of LL sessions (N = 8) and 0{\%} of control sessions (N = 8). No more than one identifiable seal responded during each playback location. We observed no responses by female harbour seals to playbacks. We conclude from these experiments that territorial male harbour seals use roars given by intruders to locate and challenge intruders. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {Decompression sickness (DCS; 'the bends') is a disease associated with gas uptake at pressure. The basic pathology and cause are relatively well known to human divers. Breath-hold diving marine mammals were thought to be relatively immune to DCS owing to multiple anatomical, physiological and behavioural adaptations that reduce nitrogen gas (N(2)) loading during dives. However, recent observations have shown that gas bubbles may form and tissue injury may occur in marine mammals under certain circumstances. Gas kinetic models based on measured time-depth profiles further suggest the potential occurrence of high blood and tissue N(2) tensions. We review evidence for gas-bubble incidence in marine mammal tissues and discuss the theory behind gas loading and bubble formation. We suggest that diving mammals vary their physiological responses according to multiple stressors, and that the perspective on marine mammal diving physiology should change from simply minimizing N(2) loading to management of the N(2) load. This suggests several avenues for further study, ranging from the effects of gas bubbles at molecular, cellular and organ function levels, to comparative studies relating the presence/absence of gas bubbles to diving behaviour. Technological advances in imaging and remote instrumentation are likely to advance this field in coming years.},

abstract = {The ability of a finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides) to discriminate the material and size of a target by echolocation was investigated. The porpoise was required to choose a standard target of a 15-mm diameter solid steel cylinder from two stimuli, a standard and a comparison target, presented simultaneously. The porpoise could distinguish a standard cylinder from acrylic resin and brass targets, but had difficulties distinguishing it from an aluminum cylinder. In size discrimination, the porpoise could distinguish the standard from 12-, 18-, and 20-mm diameter cylinders, but had difficulties distinguishing it from a 14-mm diameter cylinder. Echo measurements suggest that the porpoise is able to detect: (1) time difference between two echo highlights to within approximately 1 mu s, (2) frequency shifts of approximately 7 kHz in a broadband echo having a peak frequency of nearly 140 kHz, (3) time-separation pitch of approximately 30 kHz, and (4) target strength differences of approximately 1 dB.},

abstract = {We investigated the occurrence of harbour porpoises in the North Sea off Schleswig-Holstein by conducting aerial surveys with emphasis on calves. Fourteen per cent of the sighted porpoises off the islands of Sylt, Amrum and southern Romo were calves, whereas the average calf proportion for the whole North Sea as established during the 1994 SCANS survey was only 5.4{\%}. The significantly higher proportion of calves off Sylt and Armum indicates that these coastal waters are used as a preferred calving ground for harbour porpoises. Analysis of stranding data showed that the identified calving ground does not extend south of Amrum and that harbour porpoise calves are present off Sylt and Amrum all year round. The combination of sighting and stranding data demonstrates the special importance of the investigated area for harbour porpoises as a calving and nursing ground. The area should therefore be protected. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Researchers studying animal societies often begin by testing whether a population shows nonrandom social structure, by comparing observed social associations with the predictions of a null model. Association data comprises observations of individuals in groups, which are observed through repeated surveys. Each survey is conducted on a discrete occasion, for example, within 1 day or 1 week. Current null models randomize the interactions among individuals, while preserving two key elements of the data: the number of times that each individual has been seen, and the sizes of observed groups. A critical assumption of existing permutation methods is that each observed group is independent. However, this assumption is often violated. Typically, researchers search a large study area, relative to the distances moved by animals within the sampling occasion. Thus, most individuals will not have had opportunity to change their group associations during a sampling occasion. We show how randomization tests should be modified to account for this nonindependence of group membership. We generated association data sets in which we randomly assigned individuals to groups. We tested these data sets for nonrandom structure using the generally accepted [`]trial swap' algorithm. We found that spurious conclusions of nonrandom structure occur when we allowed permutation of individuals across sampling occasions, but not when we [`]blocked' the data by sampling occasion, and constrained our randomizations to permute individuals only among groups within each block.},

abstract = {The expansion of offshore renewables has raised concerns over potential disturbance to coastal cetaceans. In this study, we used passive acoustic monitoring to assess whether cetaceans responded to pile-driving noise during the installation of two 5MW offshore wind turbines off NE Scotland in 2006. Monitoring was carried out at both the turbine site and a control site in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Harbour porpoises occurred regularly around the turbine site in all years, but there was some evidence that porpoises did respond to disturbance from installation activities. We use these findings to highlight how uncertainty over cetacean distribution and the scale of disturbance effects constrains opportunities for B-A-C-I studies. We explore alternative approaches to assessing the impact of offshore wind farm upon cetaceans, and make recommendations for the research and monitoring that will be required to underpin future developments.},

A single 1 639-cm3 air gun with a source level of 223 dB re 1-mu-Pa was used to produce peak pressures above 186 dB re 1-mu-Pa at the base of rockfish aggregations. There was an average decline in catch-per-unit-effort of - 52.4{\%} (90{\%} confidence interval - 27.9{\%}, - 76.9{\%}) under emission conditions relative to control trials. This overall decline was also reflected in the individual catches of chilipepper (S. goodei (alpha = 0.046)), bocaccio (S. paucispinis (alpha = 0.007)), and greenspotted rockfish (S. chlorostictus (alpha = 0.021)). The overall reduction in catch translated to an average economic loss of 49.8{\%} (90{\%} confidence interval - 21.7{\%}, - 77.9{\%}) under the test conditions of this experiment. Fathometer recordings during the study showed no significant change in an index of aggregation size as the result of air-gun emissions (alpha = 0.374). However, aggregation height appeared to change as the result of emission (alpha = 0.094) after adjustment for species composition of the catch.},

abstract = {Heterochronic studies compare ontogenetic trajectories of an organ in different species: here, the skulls of common chimpanzees and modern humans. A growth trajectory requires three parameters: size, shape, and ontogenetic age. One of the great advantages of the Procrustes method is the precise definition of size and shape for whole organs such as the skull. The estimated ontogenetic age (dental stages) is added to the plot to give a graphical representation to compare growth trajectories. We used the skulls of 41 Homo sapiens and 50 Pan troglodytes at various stages of growth. The Procrustes superimposition of all specimens was completed by statistical procedures (principal component analysis, multivariate regression, and discriminant function) to calculate separately size-related shape changes (allometry common to chimpanzees and humans), and interspecific shape differences (discriminant function). The results confirm the neotenic theory of the human skull (sensu Gould [1977] Ontogeny and Phylogeny, Cambridge: Harvard University Press; Alberch et al. [1979] Paleobiology 5:296-317), but modify it slightly. Human growth is clearly retarded in terms of both the magnitude of changes (size-shape covariation) and shape alone (size-shape dissociation) with respect to the chimpanzees. At the end of growth, the adult skull in humans reaches an allometric shape (size-related shape) which is equivalent to that of juvenile chimpanzees with no permanent teeth, and a size which is equivalent to that of adult chimpanzees. Our results show that human neoteny involves not only shape retardation (paedomorphosis), but also changes in relative growth velocity. Before the eruption of the first molar, human growth is accelerated, and then strongly decelerated, relative to the growth of the chimpanzee as a reference. This entails a complex process, which explains why these species reach the same overall (i.e., brain + face) size in adult stage. The neotenic traits seem to concern primarily the function of encephalization, but less so other parts of the skull. Our results, based on the discriminant function, reveal that additional structural traits (corresponding to the nonallometric part of the shape which is specific to humans) are rather situated in the other part of the skull. They mainly concern the equilibrium of the head related to bipedalism, and the respiratory and masticatory functions. Thus, the reduced prognathism, the flexed cranial base (forward position of the foramen magnum which is brought closer to the palate), the reduced anterior portion of the face, the reduced glabella, and the prominent nose mainly correspond to functional innovations which have nothing to do with a neotenic process in human evolution. The statistical analysis used here gives us the possibility to point out that some traits, which have been classically described as paedomorphic because they superficially resemble juvenile traits, are in reality independent of growth.},

abstract = {Vocalisations and vocalising bouts of adult male leopard seals recorded from the Prydz Bay region, East Antarctica, were compared to determine whether they showed individual variability. There were distinct individual patterns in the sequence of vocalisations within vocalising bouts. A sequence could be reliably ascribed to a particular individual with a high degree (83{\%}) of certainty. Such sequences may carry information about the identity of the caller. Acoustic characteristics of the two most commonly used vocalisations, the high and low double trills, showed weak within individual variation. Although differences were observed among individuals in the high double trill few were observed in the low double trill consequently the low double trills of some individuals could not be reliably ascribed to any particular seal. For many species, individual variation occurs in acoustic characteristics of specific vocalisations rather than in the sequence in which the vocalisations are produced. The acoustic displays of solitary species such as the leopard seal, are constrained by the difficulties of detecting and recognising the signal at a distance. Vocalisation sequences may be less adversely affected by signal degradation and so could be effective for communicating information over distance. It has been suggested that individual acoustic variation is found primarily in gregarious species however findings from the current study suggest that solitary animals using long-range underwater acoustic displays may convey individual variability in their vocalising sequence patterns.},

abstract = {The assembly of semiconductor nanowires and carbon nanotubes into nanoscale devices and circuits could enable diverse applications in nanoelectronics and photonics(1). Individual semiconducting nanowires have already been configured as field-effect transistors(2), photodetectors(3) and bio/chemical sensors(4). More sophisticated light-emitting diodes(5) (LEDs) and complementary and diode logic(6-8) devices have been realized using both n- and p-type semiconducting nanowires or nanotubes. The n- and p-type materials have been incorporated in these latter devices either by crossing p- and n-type nanowires(2,5,6,9) or by lithographically defining distinct p- and n-type regions in nanotubes 8,10, although both strategies limit device complexity. In the planar semiconductor industry, intricate n- and p-type and more generally compositionally modulated (that is, superlattice) structures are used to enable versatile electronic and photonic functions. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of semiconductor nanowire superlattices from group III-V and group IV materials. (The superlattices are created within the nanowires by repeated modulation of the vapour-phase semiconductor reactants during growth of the wires.) Compositionally modulated superlattices consisting of 2 to 21 layers of GaAs and GaP have been prepared. Furthermore, n-Si/p-Si and n-InP/p-InP modulation doped nanowires have been synthesized. Single-nanowire photoluminescence, electrical transport and electroluminescence measurements show the unique photonic and electronic properties of these nanowire superlattices, and suggest potential applications ranging from nano-barcodes to polarized nanoscale LEDs.},

abstract = {Small toothed whales of the family Phocoenidae and delphinid genus Cephalorhynchus produce long-duration, narrowband biosonar clicks above 100 kHz, that might be seen as an adaptation for short range echolocation in shallow water. This paper presents data showing that the distantly related, and larger pygmy sperm whale Kogia breviceps (Kogiidae), that is a deep-diving, cephalopod-eating toothed whale, produce narrow-banded high frequency (NBHF) clicks identical to those of Phocoena and Cephalorhynchus (f(o) = 130 kHz, Q(3dB){\textgreater}10, duration {\textgreater} 80 msec). Thus, NBHF biosonar signals have evolved on three independent occasions in the odontocete suborder, but the apparent functional convergence does not relate to anatomical or niche similarity. Rather, it is suggested that a biosonar strategy adapting to a minimum in ocean ambient noise above 100 kHz in concert with high Q auditory filters have led to convergent evolution of the NBHF biosonar clicks. Since these biosonar signals carry all their energy at frequencies above the upper hearing limit of the killer whale Orcinus orca, predator avoidance may also have been a evolutionary shaping factor of the sonar signals from these non-whistling odontocetes.},

abstract = {This paper reviews and discusses several investigations of the peripheral neural code for the directional axis of acoustical particle motion in the saccule of two fishes: goldfish (Carassius auratus) and toadfish (Opsanus tau). Most saccular afferents are directional in the manner of hair cells, having a cosine-shaped directional response pattern. The saccular sensory epithelia are orientated almost vertically in a parasagittal plane. In the horizontal plane, these epithelia are orientated obliquely with respect to the midline. Hair-cell stereocilia project perpendicularly. Thus, directional response patterns of saccular afferents tend to be orientated in azimuth parallel to the orientation of the epithelia in the head. The oblique angle of the toadfish saccule is greater than that of the goldfish, and the range of best directions in the horizontal plane for each species reflects those differing orientations. The azimuth of acoustical particle motion could be computed by comparing the relative activation of the two saccules, as is the case for the ears of most terrestrial vertebrates. The spatial patterns of saccular hair-cell orientation of most fishes thus appear to have little function in azimuthal source location, but for toadfish are probably most important for determining the elevation of monopole sources.},

Thus, the hypothesis that signature whistles are used to maintain group cohesion remains untested. To investigate whether signature whistles are used only in contexts that would require a mechanism to maintain group cohesion, we examined whistle type usage in a group of four captive bottlenose dolphins in two contexts. Individuals were recorded while they were separate from the group and while they all swam in the same pool. Separations occurred spontaneously when one animal swam into another pool. No partitions were used and no aggressive interactions between dolphins preceded separations. Calling animals were identified by an amplitude comparison of the same sound recorded in the two pools. Each dolphin primarily produced one stereotyped signature whistle when it was separated from the group. Similarly the remaining group in the other pool also used primarily their signature whistles if one animal was in a separate pool. If all animals swam in the same pool almost only nonsignature whistles were used. Signature whistle copying was rare and did not initiate reunions or specific vocal responses. The results strongly support the hypothesis that signature whistles are used to maintain group cohesion.},

abstract = {Simultaneous high resolution sampling of predator behavior and habitat characteristics is often difficult to achieve despite its importance in understanding the foraging decisions and habitat use of predators. Here we tap into the biosonar system of Blainville's beaked whales, Mesoplodon densirostris, using sound and orientation recording tags to uncover prey-finding cues available to echolocating predators in the deep-sea. Echolocation sounds indicate where whales search and encounter prey, as well as the altitude of whales above the sea-floor and the density of organisms around them, providing a link between foraging activity and the bio-physical environment. Tagged whales (n = 9) hunted exclusively at depth, investing most of their search time either in the lower part of the deep scattering layer (DSL) or near the sea-floor with little diel change. At least 43{\%} (420/974) of recorded prey-capture attempts were performed within the benthic boundary layer despite a wide range of dive depths, and many dives included both meso- and bentho-pelagic foraging. Blainville's beaked whales only initiate searching when already deep in the descent and encounter prey suitable for capture within 2 min of the start of echolocation, suggesting that these whales are accessing prey in reliable vertical strata. Moreover, these prey resources are sufficiently dense to feed the animals in what is effectively four hours of hunting per day enabling a strategy in which long dives to exploit numerous deep-prey with low nutritional value require protracted recovery periods (average 1.5 h) between dives. This apparent searching efficiency maybe aided by inhabiting steep undersea slopes with access to both the DSL and the sea-floor over small spatial scales. Aggregations of prey in these biotopes are located using biosonar-derived landmarks and represent stable and abundant resources for Blainville's beaked whales in the otherwise food-limited deep-ocean.},

abstract = {Lizards commonly climb in complex three-dimensional habitats, and gekkotans are particularly adept at doing this by using an intricate adhesive system involving setae on the ventral surface of their digits. However, it is not clear whether geckos always deploy their adhesive system, given that doing so may result in decreased (i.e. reduction in speed) locomotor performance. Here, we investigate circumstances under which the adhesive apparatus of clinging geckos becomes operative, and examine the potential trade-offs between speed and clinging. We quantify locomotor kinematics of a gecko with adhesive capabilities () and one without (). Whereas, somewhat unusually, did not suffer a decrease in locomotor performance with an increase in incline, exhibited a significant decrease in speed between the level and a 10{\^{A}}° incline. We demonstrate that this results from the combined influence of slope and the deployment of the adhesive system. All individuals kept their digits hyperextended on the level, but three of the six individuals deployed their adhesive system on the 10{\^{A}}° incline, and they exhibited the greatest decrease in velocity. The deployment of the adhesive system was dependent on incline, not surface texture (600 grit sandpaper and Plexiglas), despite slippage occurring on the level Plexiglas substrate. Our results highlight the type of sensory feedback (gravity) necessary for deployment of the adhesive system, and the trade-offs associated with adhesion.},

abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F 1 and F 2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F 1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the 'gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

abstract = {We examined several strategies to reduce seabird bycatch, primarily of Common Murres (Uria aalge) and Rhinoceros Auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata), in a coastal salmon drift gillnet fishery in Puget Sound, Washington (USA). Our goal was a significant reduction in seabird bycatch without a concomitant reduction in target catch or an increase in the bycatch of any other species. We compared fish catch and seabird bycatch in nets modified to include visual alerts (highly visible netting in the upper net) or acoustic alerts (pingers) to traditional monofilament nets set throughout the normal fishing hours over a five-week fishing season. Catch and bycatch varied significantly as a function of gear. With monofilament controls, murres responded to both visual and acoustic alerts; auklets and sockeye salmon responded to deeper visual alerts only. Seabird abundance varied across multiple temporal scales: interannually, within fishing season, and within day. At the interannual level, seabird entanglement was linked to regional abundance on the fishing grounds, a pattern which broke down at the local level. Within season, sockeye and murre abundance were negatively correlated, suggesting that if fishery openings were scheduled on peak abundance of the target species, seabird bycatch would be significantly reduced as a function of increased target fishing efficiency. Finally, both sockeye catch and auklet entanglement were highest at dawn, whereas murre entanglement was high at both dawn and dusk. Our results identify three complementary tools to reduce seabird bycatch in the Puget Sound drift gillnet fishery—gear modifications, abundance-based fishery openings, and time of day restrictions—for a possible reduction in seabird bycatch of up to 70-75{\%} without a significant reduction in target fishing efficiency. Although these tools are based on local conditions and will thus vary among years and locations, all might be exportable to other coastal gillnet fisheries worldwide.},

abstract = {Surface ducts are formed by wind mixing at the sea surface and are a common feature in many of the world's oceans. These surface ducts have the effect of channeling acoustic energy for long ranges. This paper, however, focuses on the energy that leaks out of the surface duct-paths that are typically neglected by ray models. It is found that the leakage energy at lower frequencies can be surprisingly strong so that a receiver in a ray-theory shadow zone is actually well insonified. Furthermore, the leakage energy is refracted back into the duct where it may dominate the ducted paths. Inside the duct, these two arrivals add up constructively or destructively resulting in anomalously high or low acoustic levels in the surface duct relative to a prediction that neglects the leaky arrival. Thus, a full-wave model is needed; however, certain types of parabolic equations (PEs) fail for these problems because they scramble the phases of the two dominant arrivals. The same mechanism that causes the PEs to fail makes the problem very sensitive to environmental data. For instance, a change in the mean duct speed of 0.5 m/s can also produce large changes in the acoustic levels.},

abstract = {Signals relevant to different sets of receivers in different contexts create a conflict for signal design. A classic example is vocal alarm signals, often used both during intraspecific and interspecific interactions. How can signals alert individuals from a variety of other species in some contexts, while also maintaining efficient communication among conspecifics? We studied heterospecific responses to avian alarm signals that drive the formation of anti-predator groups but are also used during intraspecific interactions. In three species-rich communities in the western Himalayas, alarm signals vary drastically across species. We show that, independently of differences in their calls, birds respond strongly to the alarm signals of other species with which they co-occur and much more weakly to those of species with which they do not co-occur. These results suggest that previous exposure and learning maintain heterospecific responses in the face of widespread signal divergence. At an area where only two species regularly interact, one species' calls incorporate the call of the other. We demonstrate experimentally that signal copying allows strong responses even without previous exposure and suggest that such hybrid calls may be especially favoured when pairwise interactions between species are strong.},

Qualitative conceptual modeling was found to be useful in revealing the underlying perceptions of ecosystem functioning for these novice scientists. Preliminary results showed improvement in their ability to recognize and apply some of the attributes of complex ecosystem: non-linear feedback loops, hierarchical organization, patterns illustrating the spatial arrangements of species diversity. In addition to using models, teachers used peer-learning techniques. Collegial discussions about what they understood at particular points in time were useful in improving their understanding of ecosystem phenomenon. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

A total of 9,145 images, covering 41.7{\%} - 100{\%} of the total fast-ice cover (1,496 km(2)) of 18 different fjords and bays, were inspected for the presence of ringed seals. A total of 1,708 seals were counted, and when accounting for ice areas that were not covered by images, a total of 3,254 (95{\%} Cl: 3,071-3,449) ringed seals were estimated to be hauled out during the surveys. Extensive behavioral data from radio-tagged ringed seals (collected in a companion study) from one of the highest density fjords during the molting period were used to create a model that predicts the proportion of seals hauled out on any given date, time of day, and under various meteorological conditions. Applying this model to the Count data from each fjord, we estimated that a total of 7,585 (95{\%} CI: 6,332-9,085) ringed seals were present in the surveyed area during the peak molting period. Data on interannual variability in ringed seal abundance suggested higher numbers of seals in Van Keulenfjorden in 2002 compared to 2003, while other fjords with very stable ice cover showed no statistical differences. Poor ice conditions in general in 2002 probably resulted ill seals from a wide area coming to Van Keulenfjorden (a large fjord with stable ice in 2002). The total estimated number of ringed seats present in the study area at the time of the survey Must be regarded as a population index, or at least a minimum estimate for the area, because it does not account for individuals leaving and arriving, which might account for a considerable number of animals. The same situation is likely the case for many other studies reporting aerial census data for ringed seals. To achieve accurate estimates of populations sizes from aerial Surveys, more extensive knowledge of ringed seat behavior will be required.},

abstract = {The hearing sensitivities of two short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) were investigated by measuring auditory evoked potentials generated in response to clicks and sinusoidal amplitude modulated (SAM) tones. The first whale tested, an adult female, was a long-time resident at SeaWorld San Diego with a known health history. Click-evoked responses in this animal were similar to those measured in other echolocating odontocetes. Auditory thresholds were comparable to dolphins of similar age determined with similar evoked potential methods. The region of best sensitivity was near 40 kHz and the upper limit of functional hearing was between 80 and 100 kHz. The second whale tested, a juvenile male, was recently stranded and deemed non-releasable. Click-evoked potentials were not detected in this animal and testing with SAM tones suggested severe hearing loss above 10 kHz.},

abstract = {Continuous-time multistate models are widely used for categorical response data, particularly in the modeling of chronic diseases. However, inference is difficult when the process is only observed at discrete time points, with no information about the times or types of events between observation times, unless a Markov assumption is made. This assumption can be limiting as rates of transition between disease states might instead depend on the time since entry into the current state. Such a formulation results in a semi-Markov model. We show that the computational problems associated with fitting semi-Markov models to panel-observed data can be alleviated by considering a class of semi-Markov models with phase-type sojourn distributions. This allows methods for hidden Markov models to be applied. In addition, extensions to models where observed states are subject to classification error are given. The methodology is demonstrated on a dataset relating to development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in post-lung-transplantation patients.},

abstract = {The male harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) produces broadband nonharmonic vocalizations underwater during the breeding season. In total, 120 vocalizations from six colonies were analyzed to provide a description of the acoustic structure and for the presence of geographic variation. The complex harbor seal vocalizations may be described by how the frequency bandwidth varies over time. An algorithm that identifies the boundaries between noise and signal from digital spectrograms was developed in order to extract a frequency bandwidth contour. The contours were used as inputs for multivariate analysis. The vocalizations' sound types (e.g., pulsed sound, whistle, and broadband nonharmonic sound) were determined by comparing the vocalizations' spectrographic representations with sound waves produced by known sound sources. Comparison between colonies revealed differences in the frequency contours, as well as some geographical variation in use of sound types. The vocal differences may reflect a limited exchange of individuals between the six colonies due to long distances and strong site fidelity. Geographically different vocal repertoires have potential for identifying discrete breeding colonies of harbor seals, but more information is needed on the nature and extent of early movements of young, the degree of learning, and the stability of the vocal repertoire. A characteristic feature of many vocalizations in this study was the presence of tonal-like introductory phrases that fit into the categories pulsed sound and whistles. The functions of these phrases are unknown but may be important in distance perception and localization of the sound source. The potential behavioral consequences of the observed variability may be indicative of adaptations to different environmental properties influencing determination of distance and direction and plausible different male mating tactics.

To approach more realistic impact estimates, the effects of sound on the marine environment (ESME) model incorporates a simulation program that permits fine-scale control over simulated marine animal (animat) movement and behavior. The simulation program, known as the Marine Mammal Movement and Behavior (3MB) module, provides user control over animats that is scaleable to available information about the species of concern. Movement and behavior is stochastically determined by sampling from distributions describing rates of movement in the horizontal and vertical planes, direction of travel, time at the surface between dives, time at depth, and time in and transition between behavioral states. Influence of behavior over each of the other distributions is permitted. As knowledge of marine animal behavior, movement, and ecology increases, the flexibility and level of control provided by such models will increase the potential for realistic impact estimates},

In Brazil, Guyana dolphin whistle frequency span is 1.34–23.89 kHz, but authors have suggested that limits of their recording system may underestimate frequency span. Whistles of Guyana dolphins from Costa Rica were studied using a broadband recording system. How bandwidth limitations affect the understanding of whistle structure and species classification between sympatric dolphin species was evaluated. In addition, whistles were compared to Brazilian populations. Guyana dolphin whistle frequency span was 1.38 up to 48.40 kHz, greater than previously reported. Bandwidth limitations explained 89{\%} of the whistle variation between studies, and increase in bandwidth improved the whistle classification of Guyana dolphins. Whistle duration and minimum frequency were the most important variables in dolphin species classification. Finally, after accounting for differences in recording systems, Costa Rican Guyana dolphins whistled with significantly higher frequency than Brazilian populations, providing evidence for a postulated increase in frequency from south to north. The study concludes that equipment with an upper frequency limit of at least 50 kHz  150 kHz for harmonics  is required to capture the entire whistle repertoire of the Guyana dolphin.},

abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (mainly Salpa thompsoni) are major grazers in the Southern Ocean, and krill support commercial fisheries. Their density distributions have been described in the period 1926-51, while recent localized studies suggest short-term changes. To examine spatial and temporal changes over larger scales, we have combined all available scientific net sampling data from 1926 to 2003. This database shows that the productive southwest Atlantic sector contains {\textgreater}50{\%} of Southern Ocean krill stocks, but here their density has declined since the 1970s. Spatially, within their habitat, summer krill density correlates positively with chlorophyll concentrations. Temporally, within the southwest Atlantic, summer krill densities correlate positively with sea-ice extent the previous winter. Summer food and the extent of winter sea ice are thus key factors in the high krill densities observed in the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Krill need the summer phytoplankton blooms of this sector, where winters of extensive sea ice mean plentiful winter food from ice algae, promoting larval recruitment and replenishing the stock. Salps, by contrast, occupy the extensive lower-productivity regions of the Southern Ocean and tolerate warmer water than krill. As krill densities decreased last century, salps appear to have increased in the southern part of their range. These changes have had profound effects within the Southern Ocean food web.},

Here we report directional and frequency sensitivity in a teleost fish (Dormitator latifrons) and effects of unilateral and bilateral removal of saccular otoliths on its hearing sensitivity. The fish had different hearing thresholds in the horizontal (-54.4 to -50.3 dB re: 1 {\&}{\#}181;m) and mid-sagittal (-58.6 to -53.1 dB) planes. At 100 Hz, unilateral otolith removal did not significantly change hearing sensitivity in the mid-sagittal plane, but caused selective reductions of auditory sensitivity by 3-7 dB in the azimuthal axes that are consistent with the longitudinal axis of the damaged saccule. Along the fish's longitudinal axis, unilateral otolith removal significantly decreased auditory sensitivity at 50 Hz and 400 Hz, but not at 100 Hz, 200 Hz, and 345 Hz. At 100 Hz, bilateral otolith removal resulted in robust hearing loss of 27-35 dB at different axes in both horizontal and mid-sagittal planes. Along the fish's longitudinal axis, the bilateral removal reduced auditory sensitivity by 13-27 dB at the different frequencies. Therefore, these results demonstrate that the saccule plays important roles in directional hearing and frequency responses.},

Policy measures that encourage adoption of water-conserving irrigation technologies are widely believed to make more water available for cities and the environment. However, little integrated analysis has been conducted to test this hypothesis. This article presents results of an integrated basin-scale analysis linking biophysical, hydrologic, agronomic, economic, policy, and institutional dimensions of the Upper Rio Grande Basin of North America. It analyzes a series of water conservation policies for their effect on water used in irrigation and on water conserved. In contrast to widely-held beliefs, our results show that water conservation subsidies are unlikely to reduce water use under conditions that occur in many river basins. Adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies reduces valuable return flows and limits aquifer recharge. Policies aimed at reducing water applications can actually increase water depletions. Achieving real water savings requires designing institutional, technical, and accounting measures that accurately track and economically reward reduced water depletions. Conservation programs that target reduced water diversions or applications provide no guarantee of saving water.},

abstract = {The acoustic environment has a major influence in shaping animal communication systems. Humans, particularly in cities, profoundly alter the acoustic structure of their environment. Recent articles have identified effects of noise on animal communication and behaviour. These studies, however, serve to highlight the surprising dearth of research on the behavioural responses of animals to altered acoustic environments. We argue that noise is not the only aspect of urban bioacoustics that researchers should explore. In addition to elevated noise levels, urban areas are characterized by a spatial heterogeneity in noise levels, predictable diurnal variation in noise levels and the existence of many vertical reflective surfaces. All of these characteristics have parallels in natural environments. We suggest that cities are a fruitful area for future research on the evolution of animal communication systems, with more general implications for conservation in human-altered environments.

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), monitored by satellite telemetry, complete long-distance migration between the western and eastern Mediterranean basins following a seasonal pattern. This study investigated if these migration routes may be influenced by surface currents by superimposing the tracks of three loggerhead turtles (curved carapace length {\textgreater}55 cm), migrating from the western to the eastern Mediterranean basin, on Lagrangian data of current developed into pseudo-eulerian speed fields. The average travel speed of the turtles was 1.6 km h−1 and did not depend on the current speed or direction. We observed a connection between surface currents and the turtles' migration routes, although not a conclusive one. These observations show that neritic stage loggerhead turtles conduct migration in two distinct alternate phases: the first characterized by high and constant speed of travel both when swimming with or against currents and the second typified by low travel speeds and a good concurrence between the trailed routes and the course of the currents. These two phases corresponded to two types of movements, one where the turtle migrates actively to reach a specific destination (either neritic foraging, wintering or nesting ground) and the other, where the turtle drifts with the mesoscale current and forages pelagically. It seemed thus, that the influence of currents on a turtle's movements depends on the turtle's momentary behaviour and location of residence.},

abstract = {In blind, controlled field experiments, early Stage II zoeae of Dungeness crab (Cancer magister DANA) were exposed to sounds from single discharges of a 13{\textperiodcentered}8-litre array of seven air guns. Their survival and development were followed during subsequent laboratory culture. Immediate mortality was low (0 to 2{\%}) and showed no significant difference between control and exposed larvae ([alpha] {\textgreater} 0{\textperiodcentered}05). Across all treatments and blocks of the experiment, survival to the molt to Stage III averaged 88{\textperiodcentered}8{\%}. The conditional Stage IV survival rate averaged 69{\textperiodcentered}8{\%}. The times to the molts to Stage III and Stage IV averaged 14{\textperiodcentered}4 and 34{\textperiodcentered}9 days, respectively. For immediate and long-term survival and time to molt, the field experiment revealed no statistically significant ([alpha] {\textgreater} 0{\textperiodcentered}05) effects on zoeae for exposures as close as I m from the array, nor for mean sound pressure as high as 231 dB re 1 [mu]Pa and cumulative energy density up to 251 J/M2. Post hoc power calculations showed that any reduction in zoeal survival as a result of sound exposure was less than 7{\%} for survival to Stage III and less than 12{\%} for Stage IV conditional survival (1-[beta] = 0{\textperiodcentered}90, [alpha] = 0{\textperiodcentered}05 one-tailed). The sound exposures in our study were at the maximum levels likely to be experienced by a zoea during an actual survey.},

abstract = {We documented immediate, behavioural responses of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) to experimental vessel approaches in regions of high and low vessel traffic in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Experimental vessel approaches elicited significant changes in the behaviour of targeted dolphins when compared with their behaviour before and after approaches. During approaches, focal dolphin groups became more compact, had higher rates of change in membership and had more erratic speeds and directions of travel. Dolphins in the region of low vessel traffic (control site) had stronger and longer-lasting responses than did dolphins in the region of high vessel traffic (impact site). In the absence of additional information, the moderated behavioural responses of impact-site dolphins probably would be interpreted to mean that long-term vessel activity within a region of tourism had no detrimental effect on resident dolphins. However, another study showed that dolphin-watching tourism in Shark Bay has contributed to a long-term decline in dolphin abundance within the impact site (Bejder et al., in press, Conservation Biology). Those findings suggest that we documented moderated responses not because impact-site dolphins had become habituated to vessels but because those individuals that were sensitive to vessel disturbance left the region before our study began. This reinterpretation of our findings led us to question the traditional premise that short-term behavioural responses are sufficient indicators of impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on wildlife.

abstract = {Fishes have evolved a diversity of sound-generating organs and acoustic signals of various temporal and spectral content. Additionally, representatives of many teleost families such as otophysines, anabantoids, mormyrids and holocentrids possess accessory structures that enhance hearing abilities by acoustically coupling air-¢lled cavities to the inner ear. Contrary to the accessory hearing structures such asWeberian ossicles in otophysines and suprabranchial chambers in anabantoids, sonic organs do not occur in all members of these taxa. Comparison of audiograms among nine representatives of seven otophysan families from four orders revealed major di¡erences in auditory sensitivity, especially at higher frequencies (41kHz) where thresholds di¡ered by up to 50 dB. These di¡erences showed no apparent correspondence to the ability to produce sounds (vocal versus non-vocal species) or to the spectral content of species-speci¢c sounds. In anabantoids, the lowest auditory thresholds were found in the blue gouramiTrichogaster trichopterus, a species not thought to be vocal. Dominant frequencies of sounds correspondedwith optimal hearing bandwidth in two out of three vocalizing species. Based on these results, it is concluded that the selective pressures involved in the evolution of accessory hearing structures and in the design of vocal signals were other than those serving to optimize acoustic communication.},

abstract = {A long-baseline (LBL) acoustic system has been developed for the tracking of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) that have been tagged with digital acoustic recording devices (DTAGs), providing quantitative observations of submerged whale behavior during bubble net feeding. The system includes three high-frequency acoustic sources deployed from small boats that follow the whale after the animal has been tagged. Integrated global positioning systems (GPSs) provide positioning and synchronized operation of the sources. Time-encoded acoustic signals from the sources are recorded along with whale vocalizations and ambient noise on the whale tag. Time-of-flight measurements, as measured by the tag acoustic data, are converted to range from the whale to each source with a measured sound-speed profile. A nonlinear least squares solution is then solved for the whale's position with a nominal positional fix rate of once per second. The system is demonstrated with data collected from a tagged animal in summer 2007. Dead-reckoned track generation methods commonly used in previous studies are shown to capture the qualitative nature of the whale track, albeit with poor absolute positional accuracy, and to distort the track when the whale's movement is predominantly vertical. In contrast, the LBL data can provide quantitative measures of whale behavior. Transit speeds between bubble net feeding events for this case study are found to range from 0.7 to 1.9 m {\&}x00B7; s-1 (n = 8). The mean diameter of bubble net curtains are measured to range from 9.6 to 10.9 m. Whale speeds during bubble net rotations vary from 1.0 to 1.9 m {\&}x00B7; s-1 (n = 6).},

abstract = {Abstract   Snapping shrimp are highly aggressive decapod crustaceans, with large, asymmetric chelae. Body size determines the outcome of both inter- and intrasexual interactions. Both the body and chela sizes of mated pairs are correlated, but the body size correlation is significantly stronger. In competitive interactions between individuals of the same sex, larger individuals usually win. Because the size of the major chela is a function of body size in both males and females, chela size could be used to assess body size early in interactions, before engaging in more high risk behaviors. To determine whether the major chela is used in size assessment, I presented shrimp with isolated chelae. Male snapping shrimp responded aggressively to isolated chelae when they were fixed open in a display posture, and the degree of aggressive response depended on the relative size of the chela. These data provide direct experimental evidence for the use of a visual signal in size assessment. Females, in contrast, responded aggressively to both the open and closed chela, and their responses did not depend on relative size. This sex difference in response may be due to differences in the value of certain resources, such as shelters, to males and females: females may be more willing to respond aggressively regardless of the apparent size of their opponent, in order to acquire more reliable information regarding size, motivation or fighting ability.},

abstract = {Abstract In the context of Bayes estimation via Gibbs sampling, with or without data augmentation, a simple approach is developed for computing the marginal density of the sample data (marginal likelihood) given parameter draws from the posterior distribution. Consequently, Bayes factors for model comparisons can be routinely computed as a by-product of the simulation. Hitherto, this calculation has proved extremely challenging. Our approach exploits the fact that the marginal density can be expressed as the prior times the likelihood function over the posterior density. This simple identity holds for any parameter value. An estimate of the posterior density is shown to be available if all complete conditional densities used in the Gibbs sampler have closed-form expressions. To improve accuracy, the posterior density is estimated at a high density point, and the numerical standard error of resulting estimate is derived. The ideas are applied to probit regression and finite mixture models.},

The recordings were made in July, 2002 by a large-vertical-aperture, 131-element, 2D billboard array. The chorus, observed predominantly on two consecutive nights during the 8-day experiment, is composed of two bands of energy centered around 1.5 kHz and between 4 and 5 kHz. It causes a complete reversal in the vertical directional characteristics of the mid-frequency ambient sound field between day and nighttime periods; whereas the vertical structure during the day shows a notch in the horizontal direction with levels more than 10 dB below those at higher angles, the nighttime levels in the horizontal can exceed those at other vertical angles by more than 10 dB. These nighttime sounds also are strongly anisotropic in azimuth; they appear to come mainly from a popular Southern California fishing spot where the water depths exceed 75 in. Vertical beam-to-beam coherence squared estimates suggest the chorus source region exists on spatial scales greater than the multipath interference wavelengths of this environment. Individual sounds comprising the chorus, although difficult to separate from the background din, have a fluttering, rasping character. (c) 2006 Acoustical Society of America.},

Nine variables were extracted from each whistle contour, and the whistle contours shapes were classified into the seven categories described in Driscoll (1995). The analysis showed mean beginning and ending frequencies values of 10.78 and 12.74 kHz, respectively. On average, whistle duration was relatively short, with mean values around 0.495 s (N=702). Comparative analyses were also conducted to investigate the relationship between the obtained results and those presented in previous studies. When comparing averages, the results of the study of Oswald et al. (2003) in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) presented less significant differences in relation to this study; only whistle duration differed significantly between both works. The results of multivariate classification tests also pointed TEP population as the closest related to the population studied here. The similarities between such disjunct populations might be attributed to a more recent isolation event (the closing of the Panama Isthmus) than the divergence that has driven North and South Atlantic populations apart.

I review recent literature, asking, first, which processes are involved in the evolutionary success of transferred genes and, secondly, about the extent of horizontal gene transfer towards different evolutionary times. Moreover, I discuss the feasibility of reconstructing ancient phylogenetic relationships in the face of horizontal gene transfer. Finally, I discuss how horizontal gene transfer fits in the current neo-Darwinian evolutionary paradigm and conclude there is a need for a new evolutionary paradigm that includes horizontal gene transfer as well as other mechanisms in the explanation of evolution.},

abstract = {The exploitation of information is a key adaptive behavior of social animals, and many animals produce costly signals to communicate with conspecifics. In contrast, bats produce ultrasound for auto-communication, i.e., they emit ultrasound calls and behave in response to the received echo. However, ultrasound echolocation calls produced by non-flying bats looking for food are energetically costly. Thus, if they are produced in a non-foraging or navigational context this indicates an energetic investment, which must be motivated by something. We quantified the costs of the production of such calls, in stationary, non-foraging lesser bulldog bats (Noctilio albiventris) and found metabolic rates to increase by 0.021 ± 0.001 J/pulse (mean ± standard error). From this, we estimated the metabolic rates of N. albiventris when responding with ultrasound echolocation calls to playbacks of echolocation calls from familiar and unfamiliar conspecific as well as heterospecific bats. Lesser bulldog bats adjusted their energetic investment to the social information contained in the presented playback. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that in addition to orientation and foraging, ultrasound calls in bats may also have function for active communication.},

abstract = {The Neotropical frog-eating bat, Trachops cirrhosus, primarily hunts stationary prey, either by gleaning on the wing, or in a sit-and-wait mode hanging from a perch. It listens passively for prey-generated sounds, but uses echolocation in all stages of the hunt. Like other bats in the family Phyllostomidae, T. cirrhosus has a conspicuous nose leaf, hypothesized to direct and focus echolocation calls emitted from the nostrils. T. cirrhosus is highly flexible in its cognitive abilities and its use of sensory strategies for prey detection. Additionally, T. cirrhosus has been observed to echolocate both with closed and open mouth. We hypothesize that its flexibility extends to echolocation call design. We investigated the effect of hunting mode, perching or flying, as well as the effect of mouth opening, on the acoustic parameters and directionality of the echolocation call. We used a multi-microphone array, a high-speed video camera, and a microphone-diode-video system to directly visualize the echolocation sound beam synchronized with the bat's behavior. We found that T. cirrhosus emits a highly directional sound beam with half amplitude angle (HAM) of 12-18° and DI (directionality index) of {\~{}}17 dB, among the most directional bat sonar beams measured to date. The directionality was high both when flying and when perching. The emitted intensity was low, around 88 dB SPL at 10 cm from the mouth, when hanging, but higher, around 100 dB SPL at 10 cm, when flying or just before take-off. Our data suggests that the limited search volume of T. cirrhosus sonar beam defined by the high directionality and the rather low intensity of its echolocation calls is adapted to the highly cluttered hunting habitat and to the perch hunting mode.},

There is a clear lack of general rules regarding the impacts of global warming on biota. Here, we present a metaanalysis of the effect of climate change on body size of ectothermic aquatic organisms (bacteria, phyto- and zooplankton, and fish) from the community to the individual level. Using long-term surveys, experimental data and published results, we show a significant increase in the proportion of small-sized species and young age classes and a decrease in size-at-age. These results are in accordance with the ecological rules dealing with the temperature{\^{a}}€“size relationships (i.e., Bergmann's rule, James' rule and Temperature{\^{a}}€“Size Rule). Our study provides evidence that reduced body size is the third universal ecological response to global warming in aquatic systems besides the shift of species ranges toward higher altitudes and latitudes and the seasonal shifts in life cycle events.},

abstract = {We present both an empirical study and a behavioural game model exploring a predator-prey game between white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, and Cape fur seals, Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus, around a small island colony in South Africa. Behavioural tactics used by adult seals appear to account for the variance in risk from sharks, while shark tactics seem more influenced by the behaviour of pup seals, probably because pup seals engage in riskier behaviours. A dynamic game model of the interaction predicts that, if pups and adult seals account for risk in a similar manner, then tactic selection used by sharks and seals should be more evenly distributed across all possible options. Instead, a second model in which pups were constrained to choose the riskiest option produced evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) solutions for both species that more closely approximated the tactics recorded, suggesting that behavioural variation within subgroups of a population should be accounted for when modelling predator-prey interactions. These results also suggest that pups may act as initiators in a behaviourally mediated indirect interaction with adult seals, mediated by the behaviour of their common shark predator; this would represent the first record of an intergenerational two-species indirect interaction.},

It was shown that most of the calls can be divided into 20 discrete types easily distinguished by ear. The frequency parameters of the sounds made the maximum contribution into discrimination between call types, while their temporal parameters turned out to be less significant. The repertoires of stereotyped calls of killer whales from Chukot, Kamchatka, and the Commander and Kurile Islands were similar, due to the presence of shared types of calls. The greater the distance between the above-mentioned regions the fewer calls were shared by the resident killer whales. High vocal activity and the phenotypic features of the surveyed killer whales implied their attribution to the resident ecological type.},

abstract = {Abstract  The behaviour of A. forsteri was studied at the South Neptune Is. in 1969-70. This paper elucidates the annual cycle, describes 20 postures and calls (several for the first time), and discusses the behaviour of adult males during the breeding season. Two factors are essential in a breeding colony: water for cooling on hot days and access routes to higher areas for females and pups during heavy seas. The young were all weaned by one year of age and absent from the island during the breeding season. A rapid increase in numbers of females occurred in early November. Births were recorded from 29 November to 22 January but the peak of pupping occurred about 20-30 December. Mating occurred from early November to late January with a peak at about the beginning of January. Numbers of adult males and females in the breeding colonies decreased sharply by mid-January. The overall ratio of adult males to females was 1 : 6-8. In South Australia some adult male A. forsteri were present on the breeding colony all the year round. Large loosely defined territories were defended in mid- October but permanent territories, for the duration of the breeding season, were not established until the latter half of November. No truly aquatic territories were held. Intertidal reefs and areas without pools of water or access to the sea were held only temporarily. Fighting between adult males was highly ritualized and, although encounters were often intense, serious injuries were rare; 30.9{\%} of 2013 recorded disputes in the breeding colonies were resolved with fighting. In only two of these instances did a third male enter the fray. There were more encounters per hr during the period of territory establishment (November) than during the period of pupping and breeding (mid-December to early January). In 367.16 hr of total documentation of the activity of territorial males it was shown that 91 - 14{\%} of the time was spent either lying (72.32 {\%}) or sitting alert (1 8.81 {\%}). This was contrary to statements in the general literature on polygamous land-breeding seals which inferred that males were constantly active. Males exist on stored energy while defending territories, so that conservation of energy (as demonstrated here) lengthens the period a male can stay ashore and maximizes his reproductive potential. Sixteen males defended territories for a range of 21-54 days with a mean of 36.6 {\&} 9.7 days. Territorial males tried to stop females from leaving their territories but could not do so against their will. No aquatic matings were observed. There was little premating behaviour and the mean duration of 30 complete copulations was 6.56+ 2.19 min. Limited data indicated that males became more efficient with experience. Subordinate males defended temporary territories on the dry rock above the dominant males on permanent sites. During heavy seas the dominant males remained with their territories while the females and pups moved up into the temporary territories. Females appeared non-selective when in oestrus and were mated by the subordinate males during periods of high seas. This results in a much wider range of contribution to the population's gene pool than might be expected from the territorial system.  },

abstract = {In pinnipeds, maternal care strategies and colony density may influence a species' individual recognition system. We examined the onset of vocal recognition of mothers by Australian sea lion pups (Neophoca cinerea). At 2 months of age, pups responded significantly more to the calls of their own mothers than alien female calls demonstrating a finely tuned recognition system. However, newborn pups did not respond differentially to the calls of their mother from alien female calls suggesting that vocal recognition had not yet developed or is not yet expressed. These findings are in stark contrast to other otariid species where pups learn their mother's voice before their first separation. Variance in colony density, pup movements, and natal site fidelity may have reduced selective pressures on call recognition in young sea lions, or alternatively, another sensory system may be used for recognition in the early stage of life.},

We envision an exciting synergy between animal ecology and GPS-based radiotelemetry, as for other examples of new technologies stimulating rapid conceptual advances, where research opportunities have been paralleled by technical and analytical challenges. Animal positions provide the elemental unit of movement paths and show where individuals interact with the ecosystems around them. We discuss how knowing where animals go can help scientists in their search for a mechanistic understanding of key concepts of animal ecology, including resource use, home range and dispersal, and population dynamics. It is probable that in the not-so-distant future, intense sampling of movements coupled with detailed information on habitat features at a variety of scales will allow us to represent an animal's cognitive map of its environment, and the intimate relationship between behaviour and fitness. An extended use of these data over long periods of time and over large spatial scales can provide robust inferences for complex, multi-factorial phenomena, such as meta-analyses of the effects of climate change on animal behaviour and distribution.},

A third recording was obtained during the survey from a blue whale that was not seen. Recordings with 15, 25, and 55 min of calls were obtained from these individuals. The three recordings all contain two-part, low-frequency calls with slight interindividual variation. The calls consist of an amplitude modulated (AM) signal with a mean center frequency of 16.5 Hz, followed by a downsweep whose mean center frequency sweeps from 18.2 Hz to 16.6 Hz. The recordings are compared with blue whale recordings from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

abstract = {In large social groups acoustic communication signals are prone to signal masking by conspecific sounds. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) use highly distinctive signature whistles that counter masking effects. However, they can be found in very large groups where masking by conspecific sounds may become unavoidable. In this study we used passive acoustic localization to investigate how whistle rates of wild bottlenose dolphins change in relation to group size and behavioral context. We found that individual whistle rates decreased when group sizes got larger. Dolphins displayed higher whistle rates in contexts when group members were more dispersed as in socializing and in nonpolarized movement than during coordinated surface travel. Using acoustic localization showed that many whistles were produced by groups nearby and not by our focal group. Thus, previous studies based on single hydrophone recordings may have been overestimating whistle rates. Our results show that although bottlenose dolphins whistle more in social situations they also decrease vocal output in large groups where the potential for signal masking by other dolphin whistles increases.},

abstract = {Here we use sound and movement recording tags to study how deep-diving Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) use echolocation to forage in their natural mesopelagic habitat. These whales ensonify thousands of organisms per dive but select only about 25 prey for capture. They negotiate their cluttered environment by radiating sound in a narrow 20° field of view which they sample with 1.5-3 clicks per metre travelled requiring only some 60 clicks to locate, select and approach each prey. Sampling rates do not appear to be defined by the range to individual targets, but rather by the movement of the predator. Whales sample faster when they encounter patches of prey allowing them to search new water volumes while turning rapidly to stay within a patch. This implies that the Griffin search-approach-capture model of biosonar foraging must be expanded to account for sampling behaviours adapted to the overall prey distribution. Beaked whales can classify prey at more than 15 m range adopting stereotyped motor patterns when approaching some prey. This long detection range relative to swimming speed facilitates a deliberate mode of sensory-motor operation in which prey and capture tactics can be selected to optimize energy returns during long breath-hold dives.},

At high calling rates ({\textgreater} 95 calls/min) the background noise levels increase and individual calls may be masked. The purpose of the study was to determine if seals increase the number of elements per call in response to higher calling rates by conspecifics. Eight multi-element call types were analyzed. Six narrowband and one of two broadband multi-element call types showed a significant increase in the number of elements per call at higher calling rates. One broadband call type did not show a significant difference among the different calling rates. Our findings suggest that harp seals increase the number of elements per call in many call types to avoid having their calls masked by an increasing number of conspecific vocalizations.},

abstract = {Many vocalizations produced by Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) are made up of repeated individual distinct sounds (elements). Patterning of multiple element calls was examined during the breeding season at Casey and Davis, Antarctica. Element and interval durations were measured from 405 calls all {\textgreater} 3 elements in length. The duration of the calls (22 +/- 16.6 s) did not seem to vary with an increasing number of elements (F-4,F-404=1.83,p=0.122) because element and interval durations decreased as the number of elements within a call increased. Underwater vocalizations showed seven distinct timing patterns of increasing, decreasing, or constant element and interval durations throughout the calls: One call type occurred with six rhythm patterns, although the majority exhibited only two rhythms. Some call types also displayed steady frequency changes as they progressed. Weddell seal multiple element calls are rhythmically repeated and thus the durations of the elements and intervals within a call occur in a regular manner. Rhythmical repetition used during vocal communication likely enhances the probability of a call being detected and has important implications for the extent to which the seals can successfully transmit information over long distances and during times of high level background noise.

abstract = {Three natural sounds and one synthetic sound were played back to humpback whales during their 1985 and 1986 winter residency in Hawaiian waters. Playback was conducted from a vessel positioned within visual range of an elevated shorestation equipped with a high-precision surveyor's theodolite, used to determine the positions and movements of observed whale and of the playback vessel. A playback session consisted of 20 min of pretest observation with the vessel in place and underwater speaker deployed, followed by a 20-min test phase during which sound, or a blank tape control, was introduced. A total of 143 playback sessions, involving a total of 338 pods (a single whale or a group of whales), were completed over the two winter seasons. The major response observed during playback was a rapid approach to the playback vessel, characterized in some cases by velocities up to 9 km/h and approaches to within 50 m or less. Whales approaching were mainly singletons and, secondly, apparent adult pairs. No cow-calf pair ever approached. The approach was selective: 21.6{\%} of targeted pods approached in response to a feeding sound recorded in summer feeding grounds in Alaska; 8.3{\%} approached in response to social sounds recorded in the Hawaiian winter grounds in the presence of large surface-active pods; 3.4{\%} responded to playback of winter song; and 4.1{\%} responded to playback of synthetic sound. There were no approach responses to the blank tape control. Singing whales have been identified as males by many researchers. Data from Alaska suggested that the feeding sound was produced by a female; data from Hawaii suggests that the social sounds were produced by males. The different rates of response were attributed to the behavior of sexually active males seeking to affiliate with sexually mature females. Although a female may be present in pods producing social sounds, the presence of multiple males exhibiting aggression may inhibit the approach of other males. Song did not serve as an attractant for females, as measured by direct approach, but may still serve as a basis for female choice.},

Although only six confirmed sightings were obtained under such conditions, complementary sightings made a total of eleven confirmed records. Their distribution showed that only slope habitat, and its close proximity, was favourable to the species. In contrast to regions pointed out in the recent literature, such as the Alboran, Ligurian and Ionian Seas, it appeared that the Tyrrhenian Sea was likely to be an important area for Cuvier's beaked whales in the Mediterranean. Sighting rates of 0.1-0.25 sighting/100 km and sighting rates for individuals of 0.2-0.5 individual/100 km were obtained in favourable regions. When compared to sighting rates obtained on Risso's dolphins Grampus griseus during the same surveys, the Cuvier's beaked whale appeared to be quite a frequent species in its favoured habitats. The present study contributes a better knowledge of this poorly-known species, in the context of increasing and threatening anthropogenic noises.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reproducibility is the hallmark of good science. Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow.

FINDINGS: Version control systems (VCS), which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open source VCS, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new collaborations, and support novel uses.},

abstract = {During prey-capture attempts, many echolocating bats emit a 'terminal buzz', when pulse repetition rate is increased and pulse duration and interpulse interval are shortened, The buzz is followed by a silent interval (the post-buzz pause), We investigated whether variation in the structure of the terminal buzz, and the calls and silent periods following it, may provide information about whether the capture attempt was successful and about the size of prey detected - detail that is valuable in studies of habitat use and energetics. We studied the trawling bat Myotis daubentonii. The time between the first call of the approach phase and the end of the terminal phase was not related to prey size in the laboratory. The last portion of the terminal buzz (buzz II) was shortened or omitted during aborted capture attempts. Both in the laboratory and in the field, the mean interpulse interval immediately after the terminal buzz (post-buzz interpulse interval) was longer in successful captures than in unsuccessful attempts. In the laboratory, the post-buzz pause was longer after successful captures than for unsuccessful attempts, and the minimum frequency of the first search-phase call emitted after the buzz (F-min) was higher than that of the last such call prior to the buzz. These effects were not apparent in field data. Both in the laboratory (85 {\%}) and in the held (74 {\%}), significant discrimination between successful and unsuccessful capture attempts was possible when the duration of the post-buzz pause, post-buzz interpulse interval and Fmin were entered into a discriminant analysis, Thus, variation in the echolocation calls of bats during prey-capture attempts can reveal substantial information about capture success and prey size.},

abstract = {Odontocetes are believed to receive sounds primarily through the pan bone region of the lower jaw although much variation in jaw morphology exists among species. In order to further examine this jaw hearing hypothesis we tested the head receiving sensitivity and directional hearing of a beluga whale, Delphinapterus leucas. Hearing thresholds were measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). The subject proved to have highly directional hearing for far-field click stimuli similar to that of bottlenose dolphins and more directional than the harbor porpoise. For near-field jawphone stimulation, the beluga's lowest thresholds were found when click stimuli were presented at the rostrum tip (76 dB Fe: 1 mu Pa) although thresholds from the pan bone region Stimulation were only 2-3 dB higher. Stimulation at and behind the external auditory meatus were elevated by nearly 20 dB. Stimuli presented at the surface of the melon did not generate detectable AEP responses, although sound levels of up to 142 dB were employed. Latencies of responses were generally shortest for meatal stimulation and increased with distance. Results support a shaded receiver model for odontocete hearing but how received sounds are filtered and shaded may depend on species. We also suggest that odontocete hearing thresholds are not necessarily lowest through the pan bone region. Rather, hearing pathway variations appear to exist among odontocete species and are at least partially dependent on head morphology. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract Anthropogenic activities must be monitored to determine effects on marine mammal species, but the difficulty lies in how to measure impact. Mass strandings of beaked whales have occurred in association with naval exercises, with two species most affected, Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris) and Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris) beaked whales. Six such events have occurred in the Canary Islands but there have been no reported mass strandings in Hawai‘i. We assess the hypothesis that factors that influence the likelihood of strandings occurring and/or being detected differ between the Canary and main Hawaiian Islands, such that beaked whale stranding/detection probabilities will be lower in Hawai‘i. On an archipelago-wide basis, nearshore bathymetric comparisons indicate that the Canaries have a greater proportion and a total greater amount of appropriate beaked whale habitat closer to shore, with a steeper slope. Hawaiian shorelines are more dominated by steep cliffs, human population density is much lower, and human population per kilometer of shoreline is 53{\%} lower than in the Canaries. All of these factors suggest that there is a higher probability of a carcass washing onshore and being detected in the Canary Islands. It cannot be concluded that the lack of mass strandings in Hawai‘i is evidence of no impact.},

abstract = {North Atlantic right whales are critically endangered and, despite international protection from whaling, significant numbers die from collisions with ships. Large groups of right whales migrate to the coastal waters of New England during the late winter and early spring to feed in an area with large numbers of vessels. North Atlantic right whales have the largest per capita record of vessel strikes of any large whale population in the world. Right whale feeding behaviour in Cape Cod Bay (CCB) probably contributes to risk of collisions with ships. In this study, feeding right whales tagged with archival suction cup tags spent the majority of their time just below the water's surface where they cannot be seen but are shallow enough to be vulnerable to ship strike. Habitat surveys show that large patches of right whale prey are common in the upper 5 m of the water column in CCB during spring. These results indicate that the typical spring-time foraging ecology of right whales may contribute to their high level of mortality from vessel collisions. The results of this study suggest that remote acoustic detection of prey aggregations may be a useful supplement to the management and conservation of right whales.},

abstract = {A within-subject comparison of auditory steady-state response (ASSR) and psychophysical measurements of aerial hearing sensitivity was conducted with an individual of the largest otariid species, the Steller sea lion. Psychophysical methods were used to obtain an unmasked aerial audiogram at 13 frequencies, spanning a range of 0.125-34 kHz. The subject had a hearing range (frequencies audible at 60 dB(rms) re 20 microPa) of about 0.250-30 kHz, and a region of best hearing sensitivity from 5-14.1 kHz. The psychophysical aerial audiogram of this Steller sea lion was remarkably similar to aerial audiograms previously obtained for California sea lions and northern fur seals, suggesting that the otariid pinnipeds form a functional hearing group. ASSR thresholds, measured at frequencies of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 32 kHz, were elevated relative to corresponding psychophysical thresholds, ranging from +1 dB at 20 kHz, to +31 dB at 1 kHz. The ASSR audiogram accurately predicted the subject's high-frequency cutoff, and provided a reasonable estimate of hearing sensitivity at frequencies above 2 kHz. In testing situations where psychophysical methods are not possible, ASSR methods may provide an objective and efficient estimate of behavioral hearing sensitivity in otariid pinnipeds.},

abstract = {The ability to perceive biologically important sounds is critical to marine mammals, and acoustic disturbance through human-generated noise can interfere with their natural functions. Sounds from seismic surveys are intense and have peak frequency bands overlapping those used by baleen whales, but evidence of interference with baleen whale acoustic communication is sparse. Here we investigated whether blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) changed their vocal behaviour during a seismic survey that deployed a low-medium power technology (sparker). We found that blue whales called consistently more on seismic exploration days than on non-exploration days as well as during periods within a seismic survey day when the sparker was operating. This increase was observed for the discrete, audible calls that are emitted during social encounters and feeding. This response presumably represents a compensatory behaviour to the elevated ambient noise from seismic survey operations.},

Additionally, dive depth and swim speed of the juvenile were recorded with a behavior data logger. Echoes of echolocation signals from the water surface were clearly detected in shallow dives approximately less than 2 m. The delay time between a surface echo and a direct signal corresponded with the two-way transmission time for the animal's depth, indicating that the signals originated from the animal wearing the data loggers. The finless porpoises produced echolocation signals frequently and were thought to be able to detect their depth by listening to echoes from the water surface. (C) 2000 Acoustical Society of America.

The standard textbook advice is to respecify the model, but this is another way of saying that the researcher should change the question being asked. Obviously, however, computer programs should not be in the business of deciding what questions are worthy of study. Although noninvertable Hessians are sometimes signals of poorly posed questions, nonsensical models, or inappropriate estimators, they also frequently occur when information about the quantities of interest exists in the data through the likelihood function. The authors explain the problem in some detail and lay out two preliminary proposals for ways of dealing with noninvertable Hessians without changing the question asked.},

abstract = {Behavioral and auditory evoked potential (AEP) audiograms of a false killer whale were measured using the same subject and experimental conditions. The objective was to compare and assess the correspondence of auditory thresholds collected by behavioral and electrophysiological techniques. Behavioral audiograms used 3-s pure-tone stimuli from 4 to 45 kHz, and were conducted with a go/no-go modified staircase procedure. AEP audiograms used 20-ms, sinusoidally amplitude-modulated tone bursts from 4 to 45 kHz, and the electrophysiological responses were received through gold disc electrodes in rubber suction cups. The behavioral data were reliable and repeatable, with the region of best sensitivity between 16 and 24 kHz and peak sensitivity at 20 kHz. The AEP audiograms produced thresholds that were also consistent over time, with range of best sensitivity from 16 to 22.5 kHz and peak sensitivity at 22.5 kHz. Behavioral thresholds were always lower than AEP thresholds. However, AEP audiograms were completed in a shorter amount of time with minimum participation from the animal. These data indicated that behavioral and AEP techniques can be used successfully and interchangeably to measure cetacean hearing sensitivity. (c) 2005 Acoustical Society of America.},

We recorded animal movement and acoustic data on two tagged Ziphius and obtained the first direct measurements of behavioural responses of this species to mid-frequency active (MFA) sonar signals. Each recording included a 30-min playback (one 1.6-s simulated MFA sonar signal repeated every 25 s); one whale was also incidentally exposed to MFA sonar from distant naval exercises. Whales responded strongly to playbacks at low received levels (RLs; 89-127 dB re 1 µPa): after ceasing normal fluking and echolocation, they swam rapidly, silently away, extending both dive duration and subsequent non-foraging interval. Distant sonar exercises (78-106 dB re 1 µPa) did not elicit such responses, suggesting that context may moderate reactions. The observed responses to playback occurred at RLs well below current regulatory thresholds; equivalent responses to operational sonars could elevate stranding risk and reduce foraging efficiency.},

Calls of three fin whales swimming in the same general direction, but several kilometers apart, are believed to represent communication between the whales because of signature differences in call character, an alternating call pattern, and coordination of call and respiration times. Whale call tracks, call patterns, call character, and swimming speeds were examined during periods with and without the presence of noise. Noise sources included airguns, when the whales were subject to sound levels of up to 143 dB P-P (peak-to-peak) re: 1 µPa over the 10 to 60-Hz band, and transits of merchant ships, when the whales received continuous levels up to 106 dB rms re: 1 µPa over the 10 to 60-Hz band (115 dB P-P). Whale responses associated with these noises remain arguable.  },

abstract = {The harbour porpoise is the only resident cetacean species in the German Baltic Sea. Within the last several decades this harbour porpoise stock declined drastically, causing deep concern about its status. Plans of the German government for proposing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to implement Natura 2000 and for assessing the impact of offshore windmill constructions on the marine environment led to an increased research effort on the harbour porpoise in German waters. For the first nine, long-term passive acoustic monitoring has been conducted in the German Baltic Sea from the Kiel Bight to the Pomeraman Bay From August 2002 to December 2005. Porpoise detectors (T-PODs) have been installed five to seven metres below the water surface at up to 42 measuring positions throughout the investigated area, registering the exact times of echolocation signals of passing harbour porpoises. The proportion of monitored days with porpoise detection in each quarter of the years has been analysed. A correlation of the results with the longitude of the measuring position revealed a significant decrease from west to cast in the percentage of days with porpoise detections. Comparison of data gathered in the first quarters with the third quarters of the monitoring years displayed a seasonal variation with fewer days of porpoise detections in winter time than in summer time. Nevertheless, harbour porpoises have been detected year-round at most of the measuring positions in the German Baltic Sea. The present study clearly indicates a regular use of the German Baltic Sea by harbour porpoises with a geographical and seasonal variation in the usage of the German Baltic Sea. The larger numbers of harbour porpoise detections III spring to autumn compared with winter suggests that the German Baltic Sea is an important breeding and mating area for these animals.},

abstract = {Acoustic data collected on the R/V Cory Chouest in February and March 1996 during an active operation of the U.S. Navy's surveillance-towed-array-sensor-system low-frequency-active (LFA) sonar were analyzed for blue whale ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Balaenoptera musculus{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) and fin whale ({\textless}i{\textgreater}B. physalus{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) sounds. Operational monitoring and mitigation protocols were implemented throughout the exercise to reduce the chances of an acoustic impact on marine mammals and sea turtles. The operational schedule did not include intentional "control" periods without transmissions but did include periods when the LFA sonar was not operating for other reasons (e.g., repairs). There were insufficient detections of blue whales for further analysis. Fin whale acoustic detection probabilities were calculated from the postprocessed data. A local-linear-regression analysis was used to compare fin whale detection probabilities from 2065 11-min intervals under conditions when the LFA sonar was and was not transmitting. There was an indication of a slightly higher probability of detecting fin whale sounds during periods when there were no LFA transmissions than during periods with transmissions. This may be the result of the following: 1) Reduced vocal activity by whales in response to LFA transmissions; 2) the effect of the mitigation protocols; or 3) some combination of 1) and 2). The data presently available do not allow one to distinguish definitively between these explanations, mainly because there were not enough data recorded for periods without LFA transmissions},

Hearing was tested in half-octave steps from 1 to 22.5 kHz. Measurements were not obtainable at 1 kHz and best sensitivity was found in the range from 11.2-22.5 kHz. Considering the tone pips were short and background noise measurements were available, absolute measurements were estimated based on an assumed mammalian integration time of 300 ms. These data show sensitive hearing in the polar bear over a wide frequency range and should cause those concerned with the introduction of anthropogenic noise into the polar bear's environment to operate with caution.},

abstract = {As in all otariids, Australian sea lion, Neophoca cinerea, females alternate foraging trips at sea with suckling periods ashore, and each time they return, mothers and pups have to find each other among individuals at the colony. The need for a finely tuned mechanism of individual recognition is exacerbated by their habit of changing the suckling location. Using playback experiments with modified calls, we investigated the acoustic parameters involved in the discrimination of the mother by pups. The signature efficiency was also tested in the three environments in which reunions at the study site occur by performing propagation tests. Pups paid great attention to both amplitude and frequency modulations, and to the exact frequency values of the call to identify their mother. When severe modi. cations of AM and FM patterns were made to mothers' calls pups no longer responded to them. This may have arisen because the calls fell outside the natural species range. The energy spectrum, even though highly individualized, was not important for individual recognition. Propagation tests revealed that one particular environment was extremely harsh and did not allow accurate transfer of the individual signature components whatever the distance. In two other environments, AM was only reliable to a distance of 16 m, but both FM and frequency spectrum could be transmitted with limited degradation over 32 m. The different environments greatly influenced the efficiency of the individual identification process. Accordingly, the area in which mother-pup reunions occur is an important factor in the success of individual recognition. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {Ewes of the domestic sheep ( Ovis aries ) display selective maternal investment by restricting care to their own offspring and rejecting alien young. This trait relies on individual recognition processes between ewes and lambs. Whereas identification at the udder is only olfactory, distance recognition is performed through visual and acoustic cues. We studied the effectiveness and modalities of mutual acoustic recognition between ewes and lambs by spectrographic analysis of their vocal signatures and by playbacks of modified calls in the field. Our results show that ewes and their lambs can recognize each other based solely on their calls. The coding of identity within the vocal signatures, previously unknown in sheep, is similar in lamb and ewe: it uses the mean frequency and the spectral energy distribution of the call, namely the timbre of the call. These results point out a simple signature system in sheep that uses only the frequency domain. This engenders a signal with low information content, as opposed to some highly social birds and mammal species that may integrate information both in the temporal and spectral domains. The simplicity of this system is linked to the roles played by vision and olfaction that corroborate the information brought by the vocal signature.},

abstract = {Hearing thresholds as a function of sound-source azimuth were measured in bottlenose dolphins using an auditory evoked potential (AEP) technique. AEP recording from a region next to the ear allowed recording monaural responses. Thus, a monaural directivity diagram (a threshold-vs-azimuth function) was obtained. For comparison, binaural AEP components were recorded from the vertex to get standard binaural directivity diagrams. Both monaural and binaural diagrams were obtained at frequencies ranging from 8 to 128 kHz in quarter-octave steps. At all frequencies, the monaural diagram demonstrated asymmetry manifesting itself as: (1) lower thresholds at the ipsilateral azimuth as compared to the symmetrical contralateral azimuth and (2) ipsilateral shift of the lowest-threshold point. The directivity index increased with frequency: at the ipsilateral side it rose from 4.7 to 17.8 dB from 11.2 to 128 kHz, and from 10.5 to 15.6 dB at the contralateral side. The lowest-threshold azimuth shifted from 0 degrees at 90-128 kHz to 22.5 degrees at 8-11.2 kHz. The frequency-dependent variation of the lowest-threshold azimuth indicates the presence of two sound-receiving apertures at each head side: a high-frequency aperture with the axis directed frontally, and a low-frequency aperture with the axis directed laterally.

abstract = {The harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is the most frequently sighted cetacean in the UK, yet there is a conservation need to assess both abundance and distribution for this species. During May-August, 2002-2004 a boat-based visual survey, employing effort-related line transect methodology was conducted for specified areas of the west coast of the UK. Estimates Of relative abundance were made, with full DISTANCE analysis being carried out during 2004,for each of the areas surveyed. A generalized additive model (GAM) was constructed examining porpoise presence in relation to month, position (latitude and longitude), depth and sea surface temperature for all years and for each year of the study individually. Harbour porpoise density showed a significant decrease in the South West, with an increase for West Scotland over the study period, whilst the highest numbers for both Northern Ireland and the Firth of Clyde were recorded in 2003. The porpoise population in the south-west of England was estimated at 163 (67(LCI)-400(UCI)) individuals during the months of May and June, 387 (170(LCI)-877(UCI)) individuals were present off Northern Ireland during July, 1645 (823(LCI)-328(UCI)) individuals around the Firth of Clyde in July and 3105 (2032(LCI)-4745(UCI)) off West Scotland during August and September. The GAM demonstrated that porpoise presence increased around the loo m depth contour. Whilst further research is required in each of the areas throughout the year, this study provides important information on the distribution and habitat use of the harbour porpoise within UK waters.},

From Point Barrow, Alaska, most whales moved west through the Chukchi Sea between 71˚ and 74˚ N latitude; nine whales crossed in six to nine days.

Seven whales spent from one to 21 days near Wrangel Island before moving south to northern Chukotka. Whales spent an average of 59 days following the Chukotka coast southeastward. Kernel density analysis identified Point Barrow, Wrangel Island, and the northern coast of Chukotka as areas of greater use by bowhead whales that might be important for feeding. All whales traveled through a potential petroleum development area at least once. Most whales crossed the development area in less than a week; however, one whale remained there for 30 days.

abstract = {Fostering behavior has been reported in a large number of mammal and bird species although the relative frequency of its occurrence in most species is unknown. A commonly held view is that fostering is costly to the parent(s) engaged in it. However, empirical studies of fostering are few, and measures of either cost or benefit are even rarer. During a study of individually marked Hawaiian monk seal mothers and pups, observed over the course of maternal care, I found that 87{\%} of 30 females fostered pups. Females sequentially fostered an average of 2.3 pups (range: 1–5 pups) during the approximately 40-day lactation. The median proportion of lactation spent fostering was 34{\%} (range: 5{\%}–90{\%}). Confusion during aggressive interactions appeared to be the major antecedent of fostering and may be understandable in terms of the spatial pattern among females. The density of females with pups was relatively low for a land-breeding seal (1.5 females per 1000 m2), and the typical spatial pattern indicated a tendency toward dispersion. Yet, movements of females and pups to and from water occasionally leave females within a meter or two of each other. Several measures of the immediate reproductive cost of fostering were obtained, including: the length of time suckled by pups, the size of pups at the end of suckling, and survivorship to 1 year of age. There was no correlation between these measures for individual pups and the extent to which their mothers fostered, indicating that the high levels of fostering may be maintained in monk seals because they are not selected against.},

Explicit tests of these hypotheses are central to understanding larger issues concerning Malagasy and Caribbean biogeography, in addition to mammalian phylogeny. Methodologically, several different parameters are created with which to determine the sensitivity of resulting clades to initial assumptions about a posteriori character weighting, missing data, and multistate character ordering. Clades produced by this data set that appear despite perturbations in these parameters and that are supported by other confidence-assessment techniques contradict Malagasy tenrecid monophyly and the association of soricids with the Caribbean taxon Solenodon. Results regarding tenrecid and lipotyphlan monophyly are more ambiguous and depend on certain assumptions regarding treatment of character ordering, weighting, and missing data. An alternative phylogeny supporting an African mammal clade receives no support from the data set discussed herein. (C) 1999 The Willi Hennig Society.},

abstract = {Animals foraging in groups face different challenges, like avoiding predators and competing for food. One factor that has received little consideration is illuminance. Social animals exploiting sunlit patches could image the sun on their retinas, restraining visual perception, and, as a result, the use of personal and social information. Our goal was to assess the effects of illuminance under different levels of predation risk by studying pairwise interactions in house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus. We manipulated predation risk levels (low and high) and illuminance (low and high), and recorded changes in patch use, scanning and foraging behaviour, food intake rate, and predator detection. We found that illuminance affected the behaviour of house finches, which (a) avoided sunlit patches, (b) changed vigilance behaviour under high illuminance by reducing scan bout duration, (c) reduced foraging attempts under high light conditions, although food intake was not affected, and (d) increased the latency to detect a predator attack when foraging in pairs under high light conditions and when conspecifics showed antipredator responses that were more difficult to detect visually. If personal and social information sources about predation risk are restricted in sunlit patches, animals might increase their perceived predation risk. We discuss alternative interpretations, such as higher predation risk in sunlit patches due to greater visual exposure to predators. We suggest that heterogeneity in light conditions should be considered an ecological factor affecting foraging and antipredator behaviour in groups.

The goals of this review are to summarize this research, and by doing so, to point out apparent patterns of social recognition among the pinnipeds, as well as important gaps in our knowledge. Following an introduction of the topic, the review is divided into three sections: (1) descriptive evidence, (2) experimental evidence, and (3) patterns of recognition in pinnipeds resulting from phylogenetic, ecological and life history constraints. The descriptive evidence mostly pertains to recognition between mother and oVspring and includes vocal stereotypy, the use of other sensory modalities, and cases of adoption and allo-suckling. Further descriptive data include recognition among territorial males and between species. The experimental evidence is also weighted heavily towards tests of mother– oVspring recognition. Recognition between pinniped mothers and pups, in at least one direction (i.e., mother recognizes pup or pup recognizes mother), has been experimentally demonstrated in seven pinniped species (4 otariids and 3 phocids), but is not the rule. Recent experiments have also been completed on recognition ontogeny and salient cues, as well as demonstrating long-term recognition. Such results provide the basis for complex social interactions among individuals. As with descriptive evidence, methodologies are an important aspect of these data. Finally, all the pinniped recognition data are synthesized with respect to the variability of intra- and interspeci  c pressures aVecting the evolution of recognition behaviour.},

abstract = {North Atlantic right whales were extensively hunted during the whaling era and have not recovered. One of the primary factors inhibiting their recovery is anthropogenic mortality caused by ship strikes. To assess risk factors involved in ship strikes, we used a multi-sensor acoustic recording tag to measure the responses of whales to passing ships and experimentally tested their responses to controlled sound exposures, which included recordings of ship noise, the social sounds of conspecifics and a signal designed to alert the whales. The whales reacted strongly to the alert signal, they reacted mildly to the social sounds of conspecifics, but they showed no such responses to the sounds of approaching vessels as well as actual vessels. Whales responded to the alert by swimming strongly to the surface, a response likely to increase rather than decrease the risk of collision.},

Size of mackerel in research vessel trawls and commercial purse-seine catches: implications for acoustic estimation of biomass. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 989-994. In September after summer feeding has ceased, Northeast Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) tend to aggregate in ICES Area IVa before starting to migrate south towards the spawning grounds, between December and February. During this autumn period, the Norwegian purse-seine fleet catches mackerel in the southern part of the Norwegian Sea and the northern part of the North Sea. Between 1999 and 2005, Norway's Institute for Marine Research carried out annual acoustic surveys on a research vessel capable of trawling, to estimate the biomass concurrently with the fishery. During the surveys, mackerel were sampled with pelagic trawls (486 and 538 m circumference) at an average speed of 3.5-4 knots, and age, length, and weight was determined for use in biomass estimation. Mackerel age, length, weight, length-at-age, and weight-at-length (condition) in trawl catches were all significantly lower than observed in purse-seine catches from nearby commercial vessels, indicating that the research trawl selects younger, smaller, and perhaps weaker, fish. This finding has a significant influence on acoustic estimation of abundance of mackerel. Using data from purse-seine-caught mackerel instead of those caught in the trawl, the estimated total number of mackerel in the area of operation decreased by an average of 26.4{\%}, and concurrent estimates of total biomass increased by an average of 32.2{\%}. The results raise the importance of awareness of the differences in applying trawl samples to estimate year-class abundance and biomass and to study variations in growth and condition of fast-swimming species such as mackerel.},

abstract = {The largest perturbation on upper trophic levels of many marine ecosystems stems from fishing. The reaction of the ecosystem goes beyond the trophic levels directly targeted by the fishery. This reaction has been described either as a change in slope of the overall size spectrum or as a trophic cascade triggered by the removal of top predators. Here we use a novel size- and trait-based model to explore how marine ecosystems might react to perturbations from different types of fishing pressure. The model explicitly resolves the whole life history of fish, from larvae to adults. The results show that fishing does not change the overall slope of the size spectrum, but depletes the largest individuals and induces trophic cascades. A trophic cascade can propagate both up and down in trophic levels driven by a combination of changes in predation mortality and food limitation. The cascade is damped as it comes further away from the perturbed trophic level. Fishing on several trophic levels leads to a disappearance of the signature of the trophic cascade. Differences in fishing patterns among ecosystems might influence whether a trophic cascade is observed.},

abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO) is increasing at an accelerating rate, primarily due to fossil fuel combustion and land use change. A substantial fraction of anthropogenic CO emissions is absorbed by the oceans, resulting in a reduction of seawater pH. Continued acidification may over time have profound effects on marine biota and biogeochemical cycles. Although the physical and chemical basis for ocean acidification is well understood, there exist few field data of sufficient duration, resolution, and accuracy to document the acidification rate and to elucidate the factors governing its variability. Here we report the results of nearly 20 years of time-series measurements of seawater pH and associated parameters at Station ALOHA in the central North Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. We document a significant long-term decreasing trend of {\^{a}}ˆ'0.0019 {\^{A}}± 0.0002 y in surface pH, which is indistinguishable from the rate of acidification expected from equilibration with the atmosphere. Superimposed upon this trend is a strong seasonal pH cycle driven by temperature, mixing, and net photosynthetic CO assimilation. We also observe substantial interannual variability in surface pH, influenced by climate-induced fluctuations in upper ocean stability. Below the mixed layer, we find that the change in acidification is enhanced within distinct subsurface strata. These zones are influenced by remote water mass formation and intrusion, biological carbon remineralization, or both. We suggest that physical and biogeochemical processes alter the acidification rate with depth and time and must therefore be given due consideration when designing and interpreting ocean pH monitoring efforts and predictive models.},

abstract = {Abstract: Acoustic and visual methods were used to track and observe humpback whales off the island of Hawai'i. Sixty-two singing whales were located acoustically in water depths from 10 to 305 fathoms (mean 126 fathoms; 1 fathom = 1.828 m). This indicates that singers are not confined within the 100-fathom contour, although nearshore waters had a higher density of singers. The separation distance between singers (mean 5.1 km) was found to be significantly greater than that between nonsinging singletons (mean 2.1 km), supporting the hypothesis that song functions to maintain spacing between singers. The mean speed of singers determined from visual data was 1.79 km/h and from acoustic data 1.6 km/h. Some singers actively swam while singing. Other singers continued singing while affiliating with or being joined by other whales. The correlation between breaching and the cessation of singing suggests that the sounds of aerial behavior can convey information to other whales. These observations suggest the need to expand the traditional interpretations of the behavior of singing humpback whales obtained from visual observations alone.

abstract = {The harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in the western North Atlantic is subject to mortality due to entanglement in gillnets. Such incidental mortality threatens a population if it is too large relative to the potential population growth rate. Critical values for incidental mortality have been established by the International Whaling Commission and the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act. As in many situations in conservation biology, use of these critical values depends on demographic calculations that are based on uncertain data. It is important to report not only estimates of demographic parameters, but also the uncertainty in those estimates. Hen, we use a Monte Carlo approach to evaluate uncertainty in population size, incidental mortality, and population growth rate of harbor porpoise. To describe survival, we used model life tables derived from other mammals with similar life histories. By randomly sampling the space of model life tables and the distributions of estimated fertility and age at first reproduction, we produced a probability distribution that characterizes the uncertainty in the potential population growth rate. The median estimate for the potential annual rate of increase lambda is approximately 1.10. Combining this information with the uncertainty of incidental mortality and of population size, we estimate the probability that the rate of incidental mortality exceeds the critical values established by the various management agencies; this probability ranges from 0.46 to 0.94. We conclude that recent incidental mortality rates are a threat to harbor porpoise populations. The methods developed here are applicable to other situations in which demographic analyses must be based on uncertain data.},

abstract = {During satellite tagging of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), heart rate, respiration rate and cortisol value were measured to evaluate stress effects during handling and tagging. Respiration rates were obtained using video recordings, heart rates were recorded and serum cortisol levels were analysed from blood samples. Differences in heart rates, respiration rates and cortisol levels before and during the tagging events were investigated. An overall significant decrease Of 31.5{\%} in respiration rate was found during the tagging event period, while mature porpoises respired significantly more often titan immature individuals. Though significant differences in heart rates were found for some individuals, no general significant change for all animals was detected. We found no correlation between cortisol concentration and either heart rate or respiration rate, nor did we find any relationships between cortisol and month of year, sex and body length. As high individual variations occurred in response to tagging of harbour porpoises, it is not possible to give general advice based oil the factors investigated, on how to reduce stress during handling. However, pouring water over the animal and lowering it into the water seem to stabilize a stressed animal. Therefore, general precaution and individual judgement based on experience is essential when handling wild harbour porpoises.},

abstract = {Although northern bottlenose whales were the most heavily hunted beaked whale, we have little information about this species in its remote habitat of the North Atlantic Ocean. Underwater anthropogenic noise and disruption of their natural habitat may be major threats, given the sensitivity of other beaked whales to such noise disturbance. We attached dataloggers to 13 northern bottlenose whales and compared their natural sounds and movements to those of one individual exposed to escalating levels of 1–2 kHz upsweep naval sonar signals. At a received sound pressure level (SPL) of 98 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa, the whale turned to approach the sound source, but at a received SPL of 107 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa, the whale began moving in an unusually straight course and then made a near 180° turn away from the source, and performed the longest and deepest dive (94 min, 2339 m) recorded for this species. Animal movement parameters differed significantly from baseline for more than 7 h until the tag fell off 33–36 km away. No clicks were emitted during the response period, indicating cessation of normal echolocation-based foraging. A sharp decline in both acoustic and visual detections of conspecifics after exposure suggests other whales in the area responded similarly. Though more data are needed, our results indicate high sensitivity of this species to acoustic disturbance, with consequent risk from marine industrialization and naval activity.},

abstract = {Animals exposed to anthropogenic disturbance make trade-offs between perceived risk and the cost of leaving disturbed areas. Impact assessments tend to focus on overt behavioural responses leading to displacement, but trade-offs may also impact individual energy budgets through reduced foraging performance. Previous studies found no evidence for broad-scale displacement of harbour porpoises exposed to impulse noise from a 10 day two-dimensional seismic survey. Here, we used an array of passive acoustic loggers coupled with calibrated noise measurements to test whether the seismic survey influenced the activity patterns of porpoises remaining in the area. We showed that the probability of recording a buzz declined by 15{\%} in the ensonified area and was positively related to distance from the source vessel. We also estimated received levels at the hydrophones and characterized the noise response curve. Our results demonstrate how environmental impact assessments can be developed to assess more subtle effects of noise disturbance on activity patterns and foraging efficiency.},

abstract = {This paper is motivated by the work of Albert et al. who consider lesion count data observed on multiple sclerosis patients, and develop models for each patient's data individually. From a medical perspective, adequate models for such data are important both for describing the behaviour of lesions over time, and for designing efficient clinical trials. In this paper, we discuss some issues surrounding the hidden Markov model proposed by these authors. We describe an efficient estimation method and propose some extensions to the original model. Our examples illustrate the need for models which describe all patients' data simultaneously, while allowing for inter-patient heterogeneity.},

@article{Nowicki1997,
abstract = {During the breeding season from January to mid-April, adult male Atlantic walruses (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) dive repeatedly for an average duration of 4-6 min and give stereotyped underwater vocal displays. Between dives, they surface for 1-2 min, take 4-6 breaths, and give stereotyped vocalizations between breaths. Male walruses vocalize in the presence of groups of females and calves, young adult males, or by themselves as lone singers. This pattern is repeated throughout the breeding season and can be maintained for extended periods, sometimes exceeding 48 h. The prolonged underwater vocal displays of male walruses seem possible because the animals do not exceed the aerobic dive limit (ADL), estimated to be 9.8 min for a 1,100-kg animal, nor do they exceed the behavioral ADL of 7.9 min, determined from the histogram of dives for males singing alone. The number of breaths taken after dives and the postdive surface times remained fairly constant despite dive duration, suggesting that the walruses remained within their aerobic dive limits. The duration of most dives made by displaying males vocalizing alone during the breeding season, and dive duration of walruses feeding for protracted periods outside the breeding season, are both roughly half the estimated ADL.},

Recently, the effect of personal watercraft on marine mammal behaviour and well-being has become a topic of increasing concern. 7 lie purpose of this study was to examine the immediate effects of high-speed personal watercraft on Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) behaviour. Opportunistic surveys were conducted front a research vessel in the Mississippi Sound (30 degrees 13 ' 22.6 '' N 89 degrees 0.1 ' 36.5 '' W)from September 2003 through to August 2005. The passing of a high-speed personal watercraft significantly increased dolphin dive duration, dolphin group cohesion and dolphin breathing synchrony. Additionally, in 47{\%} of the encounters a dolphin groups behaviour changed within one minute of the presence of a high-speed personal watercraft. The most notable changes were tin increase in dolphin travelling behaviour and a decrease in feeding behaviour following the boat's presence. The results demonstrated an immediate, short-term change in dolphin behaviour, suggesting that all increase in the frequency of high-speed personal watercraft in this area could produce long-term detrimental effects. Research on the long-term effects of boat traffic on marine mammals is clearly needed to assess and hopefully mediate any potential long-term effects.},

No significant differences in dive durations were found between control observations (i.e. absence of boats) and boat interferences, which could erroneously lead to conclude that boat traffic did not induce any stress in T. aduncus. In contrast, the scaling exponents of the cumulative probability distribution of dive durations obtained in the absence of boat traffic and under different conditions of boat interferences show (i) that the presence of boats affected the complexity of dive duration patterns and (ii) that stress levels were a function of boat type. Specifically, the complexity of dive duration patterns (estimated by the scaling exponent [phi]) did not significantly differ between control behavioral observations and behavioral observations conducted in the presence of kayaks. A significant increased in behavioral stress (i.e. decreasing values of [phi]) was, however, induced by the presence of fishing boats, motorized inflatable boats and powerboats. This demonstrates that traditional approaches based on the analysis of averaged behavioral metrics may not be sensitive enough to detect changes in the distribution pattern of behavioral sequences, hence underestimate the potential consequences of e.g. chronic exposure to low levels of stress. It is finally emphasized that fractal analyses of behavioral variables, and in particular the analysis of their cumulative probability distribution function, may provide a non-invasive, objective and quantitative framework that can be used to assess the changes in stress response, and subsequently evaluate the welfare status of organisms under various conditions of abiotic and/or biotic stress.},

abstract = {Birdsong is often regarded as an aggressive signal. More specifically, particular singing behaviours are hypothesized to be threatening, including song type matching, frequency matching, song overlapping, song type switching and low-amplitude song. The term aggressive signal should be reserved for behaviours that are associated with, and, in that sense, signal aggressive escalation. Three criteria are relevant to whether a signal should be classified as aggressive: (1) whether the signal increases in aggressive contexts (the context criterion); (2) whether the signal predicts aggressive escalation by the signaller (the predictive criterion); and (3) whether receivers respond to the signal (the response criterion). Adequate evidence on all three criteria is not available for most putative aggressive signals. The evidence that is available suggests that low-amplitude song and perhaps frequency matching are strongly aggressive signals in some species; that type matching is not a signal of attack but may be a signal of lower levels of aggressive escalation; that type switching can be either a signal of escalation or of de-escalation; and that overlapping may not be a signal at all. Song performance is probably mainly a signal of male quality, but may additionally signal aggressive escalation in some cases. We propose that more attention be devoted to testing the predictive criterion: an aggressive signal should either predict attack, or if not, it should predict escalation to the next higher level of aggressive signalling, and each higher level of signalling should more reliably predict the ultimate response of actual attack.},

However, recent studies have shown that males use underwater vocalizations intensively during the mating season. In air, harbour seals are still thought to be relatively silent. In this study we describe the vocal repertoire of Eastern Canadian harbour seals during the breeding season. Harbour seals from this area produced seven vocalization types in air and one vocalization type under water. In-air vocalizations are predominantly used by adult males during agonistic interactions. Other sex and age classes also vocalize, but less frequently. Nearest neighbour responses to in-air vocalizations were primarily agonistic when any age or sex class vocalized. In this study, seals produced an underwater roar vocalization closely resembling that produced by adult males during the mating season at other sites. Eastern Canadian harbour seals appear to be considerably more vocal when hauled out than is the norm for this species at other sites around the world.},

abstract = {Echolocating dolphins emit trains of clicks and receive echoes from ocean targets. They often emit each successive ranging click about 20 ms after arrival of the target echo. In echolocation, decisions must be made about the target--fish or fowl, predator or food. In the first test of dolphin auditory decision speed, three bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) chose whistle or pulse burst responses to different auditory stimuli randomly presented without warning in rapid succession under computer control. The animals were trained to hold pressure catheters in the nasal cavity so that pressure increases required for sound production could be used to split response time (RT) into neural time and movement time. Mean RT in the youngest and fastest dolphin ranged from 175 to 213 ms when responding to tones and from 213 to 275 ms responding to pulse trains. The fastest neural times and movement times were around 60 ms. The results suggest that echolocating dolphins tune to a rhythm so that succeeding pulses in a train are produced about 20 ms over target round-trip travel time. The dolphin nervous system has evolved for rapid processing of acoustic stimuli to accommodate for the more rapid sound speed in water compared to air.},

abstract = {Toothed whales produce short, ultrasonic clicks of high directionality and source level to probe their environment acoustically. This process, termed echolocation, is to a large part governed by the properties of the emitted clicks. Therefore derivation of click source parameters from free-ranging animals is of increasing importance to understand both how toothed whales use echolocation in the wild and how they may be monitored acoustically. This paper addresses how source parameters can be derived from free-ranging toothed whales in the wild using calibrated multi-hydrophone arrays and digital recorders. We outline the properties required of hydrophones, amplifiers and analog to digital converters, and discuss the problems of recording echolocation clicks on the axis of a directional sound beam. For accurate localization the hydrophone array apertures must be adapted and scaled to the behavior of, and the range to, the clicking animal, and precise information on hydrophone locations is critical. We provide examples of localization routines and outline sources of error that lead to uncertainties in localizing clicking animals in time and space. Furthermore we explore approaches to time series analysis of discrete versions of toothed whale clicks that are meaningful in a biosonar context. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Lunge feeding by rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) is associated with a high energetic cost that decreases diving capacity, thereby limiting access to dense prey patches at depth. Despite this cost, rorquals exhibit high rates of lipid deposition and extremely large maximum body size. To address this paradox, we integrated kinematic data from digital tags with unsteady hydrodynamic models to estimate the energy budget for lunges and foraging dives of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), the largest rorqual and living mammal. Our analysis suggests that, despite the large amount of mechanical work required to lunge feed, a large amount of prey and, therefore, energy is obtained during engulfment. Furthermore, we suggest that foraging efficiency for blue whales is significantly higher than for other marine mammals by nearly an order of magnitude, but only if lunges target extremely high densities of krill. The high predicted efficiency is attributed to the enhanced engulfment capacity, rapid filter rate and low mass-specific metabolic rate associated with large body size in blue whales. These results highlight the importance of high prey density, regardless of prey patch depth, for efficient bulk filter feeding in baleen whales and may explain some diel changes in foraging behavior in rorqual whales.},

abstract = {During 1992 - 2003, 52 striped dolphin strandings were recorded in Scotland (UK). Although strandings were recorded in every month of the year, highest numbers were found in January-March and August. Striped dolphins were stranded all around the Scottish coast, but the majority were recovered from the west coast. Necropsies were carried out on 33 of these animals: 29 had live-stranded and cause of death was not established for four animals. Stomach contents were analysed for 20 animals: whiting and Trisopterus were the main prey species in the diet (both by number and by reconstructed biomass). Females had a higher average number of Trisopterus in their stomachs than did males. Trisopterus eaten in winter were larger than Trisopterus eaten in summer and both Trisopterus and whiting eaten on the east coast were bigger than those eaten on the west coast. The reproductive status was determined for six females and six males during 2001 - 2003, with the majority being immature but the sample included one pregnant female and one sexually active mature male. We calculated the length-weight relationship for this species in Scottish waters. In addition, age data were collected from samples obtained during necropsies on six striped dolphins: the oldest dolphin sampled was around 14 y old but the majority were 2-7 y old. Although the numbers are low, the regular occurrence of stranded striped dolphins in recent years around Scotland, suggests that this warm water species may now be considered resident in Scottish waters.},

We partition the fitness effects on individuals into those due to self and those due to the ‘interaction environment', and show that it is the latter that is most fundamental to understanding the evolution of altruism. We illustrate that while kinship or genetic similarity among those interacting may generate a favourable structure of interaction environments, it is not a fundamental requirement for the evolution of altruism, and even suicidal aid can theoretically evolve without help ever being exchanged among genetically similar individuals. Using our simple framework, we also clarify a common confusion made in the literature between alternative fitness accounting methods (which may equally apply to the same biological circumstances) and unique causal mechanisms for creating the assortment necessary for altruism to be favoured by natural selection.},

abstract = {Nature is rich with many different examples of the cohesive motion of animals. Previous attempts to model collective motion have primarily focused on group behaviours of identical individuals. In contrast, we put our emphasis on modelling the contributions of different individual-level characteristics within such groups by using stochastic asynchronous updating of individual positions and orientations. Our model predicts that higher updating frequency, which we relate to perceived threat, leads to more synchronized group movement, with speed and nearest-neighbour distributions becoming more uniform. Experiments with three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) that were exposed to different threat levels provide strong empirical support for our predictions. Our results suggest that the behaviour of fish (at different states of agitation) can be explained by a single parameter in our model: the updating frequency. We postulate a mechanism for collective behavioural changes in different environment-induced contexts, and explain our findings with reference to confusion and oddity effects.},

They have particular use when the data are panel-observed, meaning they consist of discrete snapshots of disease status at irregular time points which may be unique to each patient. However, due to the difficulty of inference in more complicated cases, strong assumptions such as the Markov property, patient homogeneity and time homogeneity are applied. It is important that the validity of these assumptions is tested. A review of methods for diagnosing model fit for panel-observed continuous-time Markov and misclassification-type hidden Markov models is given, with illustrative application to a dataset on cardiac allograft vasculopathy progression in post-heart transplant patients.},

For syllable diversity, oscines (who transmit song culturally) evolved more than 20 times faster at high latitudes than in low latitudes, whereas suboscines (whose songs are innate in most species and who possess very simple song with few syllable types) show no clear latitudinal gradient in rate. Evolutionary rates in oscines and suboscines were similar at tropical latitudes for syllable complexity as well as for song length. These results suggest that evolutionary rates in traits important to reproductive isolation and speciation are influenced by latitude and have been fastest, not in the tropics where species diversity is highest, but towards the poles.},

abstract = {Many theoretical models have been proposed to explain and predict the behaviour of air-breathing divers exploiting a food resource underwater. Many field observations of the behaviour of divers do not fit with the prediction that to maximize energetic gain divers should dive close to their aerobic diving limits. In an attempt to explain this paradox, Thompson {\&} Fedak (2001, Animal Behaviour, 61, 286-297) proposed a model of diving behaviour that takes into account patchily distributed prey patches of varying quality. We tested this model experimentally in a simulated foraging set-up. We measured the diving behaviour of grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, diving to patches of varying prey density and distance from the surface. Our results were equivocal with respect to the model predictions. Seals responded to prey density, leaving low-quality patches earlier. However, this pattern was still evident at long dive distances, contrary to the prediction that during deep dives seals should stay at a patch regardless of prey density. While seals maximized dive durations at high prey densities and long distances, they did not do so at short distances. The apparent quitting strategy of the seals always produced higher net rates of energy gain than would have been achieved if they had remained at the foraging site up to their aerobic dive limit on every dive. These results indicate that seals' diving behaviour, particularly bottom duration, may indicate the relative prey availability in their environment.

abstract = {Abstract   Fish hearing specialists (e.g., goldfish, holocentrids, clupeoids, mormyrids) have evolved specialized structures (e.g., Weberian ossicles, swimbladder diverticulae, gas-filled bullae) to enhance their auditory frequency range and threshold sensitivity. The inner ears of anabantoid fish are encased in membranous cranial bones and are protruded into air-filled suprabranchial chambers. This research was intended to test the hypothesis that the gas bubbles inside the suprabranchial chambers may modulate the hearing abilities of anabantoid fish because of their proximity to the membranous bone-encased inner ears. Three species of gourami (blue gourami Trichogaster trichopterus; kissing gourami Helostoma temminckii; dwarf gourami Colisa lalia) were examined. Using the auditory brainstem response recording technique, baseline audiograms tested at 300, 500, 800, 1500, 2500, 4000 Hz were obtained. The air bubbles in the suprabranchial chambers were replaced by water, and the audiograms were remeasured. Thresholds were elevated in all three species. When three blue gouramis were allowed to replenish air into the suprabranchial chambers their hearing abilities returned to baseline levels. These results support the hypothesis that air bubbles in the suprabranchial chambers can affect hearing abilities of gouramis by lowering the thresholds.},

abstract = {Field observations on Gal{\~{A}}¡pagos fur seals and sea lions indicate mutual recognition between mother and pup. High calling activity and intensive interactions of mother and pup immediately after birth appear to establish recognition within the first few hours (mother) or days (pup) of birth. Females of both species nurse exclusively their own young and reject strange ones, sometimes very aggressively. The prompt reactions of pups to their mothers' Pup Attraction Calls (PACs) suggest that the mother too is individually recognized. The analysis of the PACs of mothers and the bleats of pups shows that interindividual variability of calls provides a sufficient basis for individual recognition in both species. Playback experiments with PACs of fur seals and sea lions show that pups (10 days to 2 years old) can discriminate between their mothers' and strange females' PACs. Mother recognition reduces the frequency of dangerous encounters of pups with strange females or allows pups to approach strangers especially careful, thus reducing the risk of injury. Only by means of individual recognition can females in crowded otariid rookeries limit maternal investment to their own offspring. The mechanism of individual recognition in dispersed, ice-breeding phocids and colonially breeding otarid seals may be different. /// Freilandbeobachtungen an Gal{\~{A}}¡pagos Seeb{\~{A}}¤ren und Seel{\~{A}}{\P}wen weisen auf gegenseitiges individuelles Erkennen zwischen Mutter und Jungtier hin.

abstract = {Abstract: Pinnipeds predominately use underwater vocalizations for social interactions during the breeding season. Knowing the sex of the vocalizing individual can be of significant value for interpreting aquatic behaviour. However, it is usually difflcult to identify the sex of the caller because the individual cannot be seen underwater. Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) produce a wide variety of underwater vocalizations, as well as a number of closed-mouth call types in air, which sound very similar to the underwater versions. This study used surface calls to determine whether Weddell seals produce sex-specific calls or whether there are differences in the attributes of calls made by both sexes. In-air recordings were made of adult male and female Weddell seals in breeding colonies near Davis Station, Antarctica. Trill call types were produced only by males in air, presumably underwater these are used for the purpose of territorial defence, advertisement, dominance and/or warning calls. Assuming males and females are equally likely to use the trill call type, the probability of a trill being part of the female repertoire, but not being recorded because of sample size problems, was less than 0.0001. The DL234 (roar) and DM (mew) call types also appeared to be male-specific calls, while, DWA242 (a whistle that increases in frequency in discrete steps) is a female-specific call. The DWAG call type (alternating ascending whistles and grunts) was used by both males and females; however, there were differences between the sexes in the start and end frequency measures. Assuming that what is heard in air is reflective of underwater calling, specific underwater call types could identify the sex of the caller in Weddell seals.},

In a previous study, it was suggested that statocysts served this function, but there was no direct supporting evidence, and epidermal hair cells had not been conclusively ruled out. Experiments on Octopus ocellatus were conducted using respiratory activity as an indicator of sound perception. Intact animals clearly responded to 141-Hz particle motion at particle accelerations below 1.3 × 1022123 m/s2, and the mean perception threshold at this frequency was approximately 6.0 × 1022124 m/s2. Specimens in which the statoliths had been surgically removed did not show any response for accelerations up to 3.9 × 1022123 m/s2 at 141 Hz, which was approximately 16 dB greater than the mean perception threshold at this frequency. Specimens that had undergone a control operation in which the statoliths remained intact showed positive responses at 2.8 × 1022123 m/s2 for the same frequency stimulus.

This is the first direct evidence that cephalopods detect kinetic sound components using statocysts.},

abstract = {Markov models are a convenient and useful method of estimating transition rates between levels of a categorical response variable, such as a disease stage, which changes over time. In medical applications the response variable is typically observed at irregular intervals. A Pearson-type goodness-of-fit test for such models was proposed by Aguirre-Hernandez and Farewell (Statist. Med. 2002; 21:1899-1911), but this test is not applicable in the common situation where the process includes an absorbing state, such as death, for which the time of entry is known precisely nor when the data include censored state observations. This paper presents a modification to the Pearson-type test to allow for these cases. An extension of the method, to allow for the class of hidden Markov models where the response variable is subject to misclassification error, is given. The method is applied to data on cardiac allograft vasculopathy in post-heart-transplant patients.},

The longest period of data collection from an individual was 106.1 h. Mean dive depths and durations ranged from 14 +/- 16 to 41 +/- 32 m, and from 44 +/- 37 to 103 +/- 67 s, respectively. The maximum recorded dive depth and duration was 226 m and 321 s. This performance may not represent the maximum capacity of harbour porpoises but rather the maximum depth of the study area. Individual dives had similar rates of descent and ascent, which ranged from 1.1 +/- 0.6 to 2.3 +/- 1.4 m/s, and from 0.9 +/- 0.6 to 2.1 +/- 1.4 m/s, respectively. Two porpoises with monitoring periods {\textgreater}2 days demonstrated a diel pattern in their diving, making fewer, but deeper dives at night. Comparison of the diving behaviour of harbour porpoises with data on the depth of 140 porpoises entanglements in groundfish gill nets in the Bay of Fundy showed these seven porpoises made between 22 and 70 {\%} of dives to depths (range 20-130 m) where the majority of entanglements were reported.},

abstract = {Satellite telemetry data from 17 juvenile loggerhead turtles (43.5–66.5 cm straight carapace length) were used in conjunction with oceanographic data to analyze the influence of regional and seasonal oceanography on dive behavior in the North Pacific Ocean. Combined dive behavior for all individuals showed that turtles spent more than 80{\%} of their time at depths {\textless}5 m, and more than 90{\%} of their time at depths {\textless}15 m. Multivariate classifications of dive data revealed four major dive types, three representing deeper, longer dives, and one representing shallower dives shorter in duration. Turtles exhibited variability in these dive types across oceanographic regions, with deeper, longer dives in the Hawaii longline swordfish fishing grounds during the first quarter of the year, as well as in the Kuroshio Extension Bifurcation Region and the region near the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. Turtles in the Kuroshio Extension Bifurcation Region also exhibited dive variability associated with mesoscale eddy features, with turtles making deeper, longer dives while associated with the strongest total kinetic energy. Turtles in the central North Pacific exhibited seasonality in dive behavior that appeared to reflect synchronous latitudinal movements with the North Pacific Subtropical Front and the associated seasonal, large-scale oceanography. Turtles made deeper, longer dives during the first quarter of the year within this region, the reported time and area where the highest loggerhead bycatch occurs by the longline fishery. These results represent the first comprehensive study of dive data for this species in this region. The increased understanding of juvenile loggerhead dive behavior and the influences of oceanography on dive variability should provide further insight into why interactions with longline fisheries occur and suggest methods for reducing the bycatch of this threatened species.},

abstract = {Underwater sound recordings were made at the fast-ice edge using a Sony WMD6C audiocassette recorder from a Massa hydrophone and a custom preamplifier. This system had a frequency response from 40-16,500 Hz 2 3 dB. The hydrophone was placed 12 m under the fast ice, between 13.5 and 14 m below the water surface. Recordings were made between 0500 and 1000 on 29 and 30 October 1993 when whales were seen within the area. A total of 3 h of these had good signal-to-noise. The whales were highly vociferous. The most commonly heard call was a amplitude-modulated call, shown in Figure 1. The carrier frequency, the central line on the sonagram between two spectral lines or side-bands, was amplitude modulated forming a series of short, narrow band pulses emitted at a high repetition rate. These sounds have been referred to as pulsed tones (Sjare and Smith 1986). The side bands were representative of the modulation pulse rate of the call; the mean side-band frequency was 1,500 Hz (n = 20, SD = 284). Minimum and maximum frequencies ranged between 1,000 and 8,500 Hz. The mean starting, ending, and carrier frequencies were: 5,648 Hz (n = 20, SD = 894 Hz), 3,887 Hz (n = 20, SD = 1,073), and 4,632 Hz (n = 20, SD = 81), respectively. All calls had “wavering” frequency modulation (Taruski 1979) (Fig. 1A) and in some instances there was additional secondary fine-scale wavering modulation (Fig. 1B). There tended to be an overall decrease in the frequency through the call (Fig. 1A). The mean duration of the amplitude-modulated calls was 0.77 sec (n = 20, SD = 0.14). There were different pulse rates in broad-band clicks; click trains (Fig. 2A, B) and rapidly occurring clicks, called burst pulses (Fig. 2C). The mean number of pulses and duration of click trains was 25 clicks (n = 20, SD = 16) and 1.18 sec (n = 20, SD = l.06), respectively. The average repetition rate of clicks within click trains was 34 clicks per sec (n = 20, SD = 19). For burst pulses (Fig. 2C) the mean minimum and maximum frequencies were 3,135 Hz (n = 11, SD = 2,040) and 10,910 Hz (n = 11, SD = 1,061), respectively, and the mean duration was 0.53 sec (n = 11, SD = 0.21). The second most common calls were whistles. The mean starting, ending, and fundamental frequencies were 5,222 Hz (n = 24, SD = 2,197), 4,283 Hz (n = 24, SD = 1,503), and 4,869 Hz (n = 24, SD = 1,749), respectively. All whistles had wavering frequency modulation (Fig. 3) on a broad scale (Fig. 3A), on a fine scale (Fig. 3B), or on both (Fig. 3A). The mean duration of whistles was 0.65 sec (n = 24, SD = 0.28).},

abstract = {In the Hawaiian Islands, there is a distinct resident community of micronekton, distributed along a narrow band where the upper underwater slopes of the islands meet the oceanic, mesopelagic environment. This mesopelagic boundary community serves as an important food resource to many animals. The goal of this work was to examine spatial heterogeneity of the Hawaiian mesopelagic boundary biomass at a range of scales, in the context of its diel vertical and horizontal migrations. A modified echosounder was used to sample the coasts of three Hawaiian Islands, permitting a range of scales from several meters to several kilometers to be assessed rapidly. The Hawaiian mesopelagic boundary community fits the hierarchical model of patch structure with patches within patches that are part of a larger-scale matrix of patches. Large differences in the overall distribution patterns of the mesopelagic boundary community exist along with a wide range of overall mesopelagic-animal densities. High animal-density locations have boundary-community layers with a large (kilometers) horizontal extent, and low animal-density locations have small (tens of meters), discrete patches. Higher animal-density locations are also more complex than low-density sites, with more levels of patchiness within the same range of spatial scales, Both time of day and distance from shore significantly affected the geometric and density characteristics as well as the distribution of aggregations within the boundary layer. Horizontal and vertical structures of the mesopelagic boundary community are also coupled. In high-density sites, there is strong vertical layering in acoustic-scattering strength while in low-density sites vertical acoustic structure is absent. The differences observed in the distribution of the mesopelagic boundary community at different levels of overall mesopelagic-animal density suggest biological forcing as the dominant mechanism. A description of heterogeneity in the mesopelagic boundary community in Hawaii is the first step in understanding its importance to both neritic and oceanic ecosystems and its potential for linking these two systems.

Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

abstract = {Singing by males is a major feature of the mating system of humpback whales, (Borowski). Although a few songs have been opportunistically recorded on the whales' high{\^{a}}€“latitude feeding grounds, singing in these regions was thought to be only sporadic. We report results from the first continuous acoustic monitoring of a humpback whale feeding ground (off Cape Cod, MA, USA) in spring. Using autonomous sea{\^{a}}€“floor recording systems, we found singing on a daily basis over the entire 25 day monitoring period, from 14 May to 7 June 2000. For much of the period, song was recorded 24 h per day. These results, combined with evidence for aseasonal conceptions in whaling catch data, suggest that the humpback whale breeding season should no longer be considered as confined to lower{\^{a}}€“latitude regions in winter. Rather, we suggest breeding extends geographically and temporally onto feeding grounds into at least spring and early summer. Singing at these times represents either low{\^{a}}€“cost opportunistic advertising by (perhaps relatively few) males to court females that failed to conceive during the winter, and/or possibly an intrasexual display.},

abstract = {Many species use specific vocalizations that attract conspecifics to food sources or that recruit other group members to inspect secondary predator cues or to mob predators. However, little is known regarding the variation in the acoustic structure of such calls and the associated meaning. In the cooperatively breeding banded mongoose, Mungos mungo, we investigated calls produced in the context of group recruitment to three different stimulus types: (1) secondary predator cues; (2) snakes; and (3) members of rival groups. Calls produced in response to predator faeces differed from the harsher variants elicited by snakes and rival groups, but the latter two elicited similar calls. Only a few calls of intermediate acoustic structure were produced in response to the different stimulus categories. Playbacks of calls elicited by the different stimuli caused individuals to approach the speaker in the same way. However, calls elicited specifically by snakes and rival mongooses resulted in a higher proportion of receivers responding and a faster receiver response than calls elicited by faeces. This suggests a graded rather than a discrete recruitment call system. Thus, despite obvious differences in stimulus type and the purpose of recruitment, the acoustic structure of calls conveys information about the risk of the encountered stimulus and not the stimulus type itself, allowing receivers to adjust their response according to the urgency. Since calling continued for prolonged periods after all group members had gathered around the callers, these calls may also function to deter rivals and to coordinate the subsequent group response.},

Habituation: A dual-process theory. Psychological Review, 77, 419-450; Thompson, R. F., {\&} Spencer, W. A. (1966). Habituation: A model phenomenon for the study of neuronal substrates of behavior. Psychological Review, 73, 16-43]. In August 2007, the authors of this review, who study habituation in a wide range of species and paradigms, met to discuss their work on habituation and to revisit and refine the characteristics of habituation. This review offers a re-evaluation of the characteristics of habituation in light of these discussions. We made substantial changes to only a few of the characteristics, usually to add new information and expand upon the description rather than to substantially alter the original point. One additional characteristic, relating to long-term habituation, was added. This article thus provides a modern summary of the characteristics defining habituation, and can serve as a convenient primer for those whose research involves stimulus repetition.},

The three-dimensional pattern of sensitivity shows that input from a receptor ensemble (hair cells) is essentially equivalent to that expected from a single hair cell having a given three-dimensional orientation of best sensitivity. Fibers from the sacculus, lagena, and utriculus differ with respect to distributions of directional orientation, but are similar in best threshold (less than 1 nanometer, root mean square, at 140 hertz). In combination with other mechanisms for detection of sound pressure, this directionality is a likely basis for directional hearing in fishes, and it could allow the determination of underwater acoustic intensity.},

abstract = {In a previous paper (Hemila et al., Hear. Res. 133 (1999) 82-97) we have presented a mechanical model, based on species-specific anatomical data, for the toothed whale middle ear. For five odontocete species of six we found that the model quite well predicted published behavioral audiograms. Here we report that new published data indicate that the audiogram of the sixth and deviating species, the killer whale Orcinus orca, was from a specimen with deficient high-frequency hearing. A new published killer whale audiogram is similar to other odontocete audiograms and does fit our four-bone model. With certain general conditions, a model with isometric (middle) ears results in uniform audiograms for different species, when presented in a log-log plot; with larger ears the audiogram curves are just moved towards lower frequencies. The audiograms coincide in case all frequencies are scaled by a factor 1/m3, where m is the mass of the ear ossicles. Odontocete ears are isometric enough to show that the corresponding audiograms are indeed similar after such mass scaling. Specifically, this scaling factor can be used to predict the high-frequency hearing limits of all odontocete species. Our anatomical data and models support the notion that ossicular mass is a crucial factor limiting high-frequency hearing in both terrestrial mammals and toothed whales.},

Diel echolocation activity of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) around North Sea offshore gas installations. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 000-000. Echolocation clicks of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) were detected with T-PODs, autonomous, passive, acoustic-monitoring devices, deployed from an offshore-exploration-drilling-rig and gas-production-platform complex in the Dogger Bank region of the North Sea from 2005 to 2006. Echolocation-click trains were categorized into four phases of the diel cycle: morning, day, evening, and night. Porpoises were present near ({\textless}200 m) the platform, and there was a pronounced diel pattern in echolocation activity; the number of porpoise encounters (visits) was greater by night than by day. The number of click trains with a minimum inter-click interval of {\textless}10 ms also increased at night. This was confirmed by a comparison of the ratios of feeding buzzes to search-phase clicks (feeding buzz ratios) and an analysis of the changes in pulse-repetition frequencies within each train. A reasonable interpretation of this pattern was that porpoises were feeding below or around the platform at night. The evidence for changes in activity during the morning and evening was less clear, so these may be transitional phases. The pattern of porpoise-echolocation behaviour around this platform is related most probably to the diel activity of their prey. If porpoises cluster regularly around such installations within 500-m shipping exclusion zones, they may be omitted from population surveys. We conclude that offshore installations may play an important role as nocturnal porpoise-feeding stations in an overfished environment, but that further replicated and controlled studies are required. These findings should be taken into consideration during offshore-installation-decommissioning decisions in the North Sea.},

abstract = {The potential for acoustically mediated causes of stranding in cetaceans (whales and dolphins) is of increasing concern given recent stranding events associated with anthropogenic acoustic activity. We examine a potentially debilitating non-auditory mechanism called rectified diffusion. Rectified diffusion causes gas bubble growth, which in an insonified animal may produce emboli, tissue separation and high, localized pressure in nervous tissue. Using the results of a dolphin dive study and a model of rectified diffusion for low-frequency exposure, we demonstrate that the diving behavior of cetaceans prior to an intense acoustic exposure may increase the chance of rectified diffusion. Specifically, deep diving and slow ascent/descent speed contributes to increased gas-tissue saturation, a condition that amplifies the likelihood of rectified diffusion. The depth of lung collapse limits nitrogen uptake per dive and the surface interval duration influences the amount of nitrogen washout from tissues between dives. Model results suggest that low-frequency rectified diffusion models need to be advanced, that the diving behavior of marine mammals of concern needs to be investigated to identify at-risk animals, and that more intensive studies of gas dynamics within diving marine mammals should be undertaken.},

abstract = {During vocal contests, animals alter both the timing and the patterning of responses to their opponents. Time-specific responses (such as overlapping an opponent's song) and pattern-specific responses (such as matching the type of an opponent's song) may reveal information about interacting animals. Here we explore the consequences of overlapping and frequency matching during song contests of male black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus. Using interactive playback, we engaged birds of high and low dominance status in vocal interactions with a simulated territorial intruder. The playback intruder either overlapped or avoided overlapping the subjects' songs and either matched or avoided matching the frequency of the subjects' songs. Individuals who were overlapped by the playback intruder showed higher variability in their song length and song timing than individuals who were not overlapped. Individuals who were frequency-matched by the playback intruder responded with more agitated responses (more flights and passes over the speaker and closer distances of closest approach) and spent more time farther away from the loudspeaker. We argue that the timing of song delivery and the choice of song type are distinct functional components of vocal interactions, where overlapping and matching songs are threatening signals that have separate consequences for opponent behaviour and song performance. High-ranking males responded at greater distances from the loudspeaker in all treatments and responded with lower agitation levels than low-ranking males. We demonstrate that males of different quality show different behavioural responses to territorial intruders, where males of high status appear reluctant to engage an intruder as intensely as males of low status.},

abstract = {Estimation of tree growth is based on sparse observations of tree diameter, ring widths, or increments read from a dendrometer. From annual measurements on a few trees (e.g., increment cores) or sporadic measurements from many trees (e.g., diameter censuses on mapped plots), relationships with resources, tree size, and climate are extrapolated to whole stands. There has been no way to formally integrate different types of data and problems of estimation that result from (1) multiple sources of observation error, which frequently result in impossible estimates of negative growth, (2) the fact that data are typically sparse (a few trees or a few years), whereas inference is needed broadly (many trees over many years), (3) the fact that some unknown fraction of the variance is shared across the population, and (4) the fact that growth rates of trees within competing stands are not independent. We develop a hierarchical Bayes state space model for tree growth that addresses all of these challenges, allowing for formal inference that is consistent with the available data and the assumption that growth is nonnegative. Prediction follows directly, incorporating the full uncertainty from inference with scenarios for "filling the gaps" for past growth rates and for future conditions affecting growth. An example involving multiple species and multiple stands with tree-ring data and up to 14 years of tree census data illustrates how different levels of information at the tree and stand level contribute to inference and prediction.},

abstract = {We review developments in the study of stress in free-ranging mammals and summarize the physiological and behavioral components of the stress response. Both the sympathetic nervous system response and the regulation and reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are discussed. In particular, we describe how the activity of the HPA axis at baseline levels follows circadian and circannual rhythms in ways that allow animals to respond to predictable environmental changes, focusing largely on the endpoint of this axis, the glucocorticoid hormones cortisol and corticosterone. Superimposed upon these rhythms are the elevated glucocorticoid levels characteristic of the stress response, which allow an animal to respond to unpredictable social, physical, or environmental challenges. Methods used to explore the stress response in free-ranging mammals are described. Both inter- and intraspecific variation in the stress response as they relate to the environment are discussed. Finally, how the regulation and reactivity of the HPA axis varies by life-history stage and sex in mammals is reviewed, focusing on reproduction and development.},

abstract = {Quantitatively characterizing the social structure of a population provides important insight into the forces shaping key population processes. Moreover, long-term social dynamics provide an avenue for understanding population-level responses to changes in socioecological conditions. This is particularly true for species that show natal philopatry and highly stable hierarchically structured social units, such as the piscivorous resident killer whales of the northeast Pacific. The southern resident killer whale population is a small, demographically closed population, comprising three commonly recognized pods (J, K and L pods), that has recently been listed as endangered throughout its range in both Canadian and U.S.A. waters. In this study, we quantitatively assessed social structure in this population from 29 years of photo-identification data to characterize significant temporal changes in sociality. Preferential affiliation among killer whales within both genealogical matrilines and pods was supported by two different analytical methods and, despite interannual variability, these social clusters persisted throughout the study. All three pods experienced fluctuations in social cohesion over time, but the overall rate of intrapod affiliation was consistently lowest within L pod, the largest of the southern resident pods. The most recent increase in fluidity within social units, occurring in the mid to late 1990s, was coincident with a significant decline in population size, suggesting a possible common response to external stressors. Quantifying these trends in social structure is the first step towards understanding the causes and consequences of long-term changes in killer whale social structure.},

In recent years Alasdair MacIntyre has reintroduced a form of Aristotle's 'metaphysical biology' into his ethics. He argues that the ethological study of dependence and rationality in other species--dolphins in particular--sheds light on how those same traits in the typical lives of humans give rise to the moral virtues. However, some goal-oriented dolphin behaviour appears both dependent and rational in the precise manner which impresses MacIntyre, yet anything but ethically 'virtuous'. More damningly, dolphin ethologists consistently refuse to evaluate such behaviour in the manner MacIntyre claims is appropriate to moral judgement. In light of this, I argue that virtues--insofar as they name a biological or ethological category--do not name a morally significant one.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic or natural disturbances can have a significant impact on wild animals. Therefore, understanding when, how and what type of human and natural events disturb animals is a central problem in wildlife conservation. However, it can be difficult to identify which particular environmental stressor affects an individual most. We use heart rate telemetry to quantify the energy expenditure associated with different types of human-mediated and natural disturbances in a breeding passerine, the white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus). We fitted 0.5g heart rate transmitters to 14 male vireos and continuously recorded heart rate and activity for two days and three nights on a military installation. We calibrated heart rate to energy expenditure for five additional males using an open-flow, push-through respirometry system showing that heart rate predicted 74 per cent of energy expenditure. We conducted standardized disturbance trials in the field to experimentally simulate a natural stressor (predator presence) and two anthropogenic stressors. Although birds initially showed behavioural and heart rate reactions to some disturbances, we could not detect an overall increase in energy expenditure during 1- or 4-hours disturbances. Similarly, overall activity rates were unaltered between control and experimental periods, and birds continued to perform parental duties despite the experimental disturbances. We suggest that vireos quickly determined that disturbances were non-threatening and thus showed no (costly) physiological response. We hypothesize that the lack of a significant response to disturbance in vireos is adaptive and may be representative of animals with fast life histories (e.g. short lifespan, high reproductive output) so as to maximize energy allocation to reproduction. Conversely, we predict that energetic cost of human-mediated disturbances will be significant in slow-living animals.},

abstract = {The impact of naval sonar on beaked whales is of increasing concern. In recent years the presence of gas and fat embolism consistent with decompression sickness (DCS) has been reported through postmortem analyses on beaked whales that stranded in connection with naval sonar exercises. In the present study, we use basic principles of diving physiology to model nitrogen tension and bubble growth in several tissue compartments during normal diving behavior and for several hypothetical dive profiles to assess the risk of DCS. Assuming that normal diving does not cause nitrogen tensions in excess of those shown to be safe for odontocetes, the modeling indicates that repetitive shallow dives, perhaps as a consequence of an extended avoidance reaction to sonar sound, can indeed pose a risk for DCS and that this risk should increase with the duration of the response. If the model is correct, then limiting the duration of sonar exposure to minimize the duration of any avoidance reaction therefore has the potential to reduce the risk of DCS.},

abstract = {Abstract This study investigates the effects of the construction and operation of a large Danish offshore wind farm on harbor and gray seal haul-out behavior within a nearby (4 km) seal sanctuary. Time-lapse photography, visual monitoring, and aerial surveys were used to monitor the number of seals on land in daylight hours. Seals were monitored during two preconstruction periods (19 June–31 August 2001 and April–August 2002), a construction period of the wind farm (August 2002–December 2003), and a period of operation of the wind farm (December 2003–December 2004). Monthly aerial surveys were conducted to estimate the proportion of seals in the sanctuary relative to neighboring haul-out sites. From preconstruction to construction and through the first year of operation the number of harbor seals in the sanctuary increased at the same rate as the number of seals at the neighboring haul-out sites. No long-term effects on haul-out behavior were found due to construction and operation of the wind farm. However, a significant short-term decrease was seen in the number of seals present on land during sheet pile driving in or near the wind farm. Acoustic deterrents were utilized simultaneously to avoid hearing damage.},

abstract = {Harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) visit Ramsey Sound at specific states of tide to feed. The preferred foraging location is high-energy habitat in South Ramsey Sound where a tide race, overfalls and upwelling zones form during the ebb phase. Seabed topography and tidal currents combine to create a foraging resource exploited by harbour porpoises at regular and predictable intervals. Porpoises are observed surfacing repeatedly directly into the tidal stream above and adjacent to, a steep-sided trench on the seabed. Tidal currents and the steep walls of the trench are believed to concentrate prey which is funnelled towards the waiting porpoises. Schools with calves prefer areas on the periphery of the fastest flowing water, where current speeds are lower. The presence of harbour porpoises is restricted almost entirely to the ebb tidal phase, but porpoises regularly occupy this site for the entire ebb phase. Harbour porpoise foraging in a tide race habitat is widely reported from the geographical range of the harbour porpoise and raises issues regarding foraging strategy and the net energetic value of hunting prey in high-energy environments.},

Although porpoises preyed on a variety of species, only a few contributed substantially to the diet. Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) was the dominating prey species for both juveniles and adults. Our results, in combination with those from previous studies, suggest that where herring is a dominant food source, porpoises prey primarily on size classes containing mature or maturing individuals. Further, we also show that Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) may be an important food resource, at least for adult porpoises. Examination of sample size requirement showed that, depending on the taxonomic level used to describe the diet, a minimum of 35-71 stomachs are needed to be confident that all common prey species will be found.},

Previous Studies have been pessimistic about the probability of even short-term survival of this relict Population, predicting its likely extinction by the start of the 21st century because of a range of anthropogenic threats. However, new surveys (sign surveys and interviews with villagers and subsistence farmers) and the discovery of three dead solenodons confirm the continued Survival of the species in the Duchity region, apparently across a greater geographic area than previously recognized. This may reflect a cull on dogs around the Duchity region. Given the lack of any targeted mammal conservation research in Haiti for almost 2 decades, immediate further investigation is required into solenodon distribution, habitat utilization, density, and interaction with introduced predators across the region. The solenodons of the Massif de la Hotte may represent a distinct taxon, making the establishment of an effective research and conservation programme for this population an urgent priority.},

abstract = {Baleen whales (Mysticeti) communicate using low-frequency acoustic signals. These long-wavelength sounds can be detected over hundreds of kilometres, potentially allowing contact over large distances. Low-frequency noise from large ships (20-200 Hz) overlaps acoustic signals used by baleen whales, and increased levels of underwater noise have been documented in areas with high shipping traffic. Reported responses of whales to increased noise include: habitat displacement, behavioural changes and alterations in the intensity, frequency and intervals of calls. However, it has been unclear whether exposure to noise results in physiological responses that may lead to significant consequences for individuals or populations. Here, we show that reduced ship traffic in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, following the events of 11 September 2001, resulted in a 6 dB decrease in underwater noise with a significant reduction below 150 Hz. This noise reduction was associated with decreased baseline levels of stress-related faecal hormone metabolites (glucocorticoids) in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). This is the first evidence that exposure to low-frequency ship noise may be associated with chronic stress in whales, and has implications for all baleen whales in heavy ship traffic areas, and for recovery of this endangered right whale population.},

abstract = {Echolocating bats use the time elapsed from biosonar pulse emission to the arrival of echo (defined as echo-delay) to assess target-distance. Target-distance is represented in the brain by delay-tuned neurons that are classified as either "heteroharmonic" or "homoharmormic." Heteroharmonic neurons respond more strongly to pulse-echo pairs in which the timing of the pulse is given by the fundamental biosonar harmonic while the timing of echoes is provided by one (or several) of the higher order harmonics. On the other hand, homoharmonic neurons are tuned to the echo delay between similar harmonics in the emitted pulse and echo. It is generally accepted that heteroharmonic computations are advantageous over homoharmonic computations; i.e., heteroharmonic neurons receive information from call and echo in different frequency-bands which helps to avoid jamming between pulse and echo signals. Heteroharmonic neurons have been found in two species of the family Mormoopidae (Pteronotus parnellii and Pteronotus quadridens) and in Rhinolophus rouxi. Recently, it was proposed that heteroharmonic target-range computations are a primitive feature of the genus Pteronotus that was preserved in the evolution of the genus. Here, we review recent findings on the evolution of echolocation in Mormoopidae, and try to link those findings to the evolution of the heteroharmonic computation strategy (HtHCS). We stress the hypothesis that the ability to perform heteroharmonic computations evolved separately from the ability of using long constant-frequency echolocation calls, high duty cycle echolocation, and Doppler Shift Compensation. Also, we present the idea that heteroharmonic computations might have been of advantage for categorizing prey size, hunting eared insects, and living in large conspecific colonies. We make five testable predictions that might help future investigations to clarify the evolution of the heteroharmonic echolocation in Mormoopidae and other families.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to discuss the important role that behavioral mechanisms, such as contingency learning and equivalence class formation, play in the production and comprehension of auditory signals in the context of mammalian social communication. Observations and experiments on vocal communication in mammals have often emphasized the importance of learning either from the perspective of the signaler or from the perspective of the receiver. It is our goal to discuss the roles and potential mechanisms of learning on both sides of communication. While marine mammals are notable in their capacity for complex learning in their vocal communication, until now, the major emphasis has been on the study of cetaceans. In the current paper, we focus primarily on the pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses) as a source for insight into how the learned aspects of auditory signaling and receiving may be acquired. We find that the results from carefully designed laboratory experiments can aid in the interpretation of field observations of communicative behavior. The complementary use of both of these approaches improves our understanding of the cognitive operations being carried out by animals in their natural environment.Key Words: pinnipeds, learning, vocalizations, cetaceans, communication, equivalence, mammals, primates},

abstract = {Cetaceans produce sound signals frequently. Usually, acoustic localization of cetaceans was made by cable hydrophone arrays and multichannel recording systems. In this study, a simple and relatively inexpensive towed acoustic system consisting of two miniature stereo acoustic data-loggers is described for localization and tracking of finless porpoises in a mobile survey. Among 204 porpoises detected acoustically, 34 individuals (similar to 17{\%}) were localized, and 4 of the 34 localized individuals were tracked. The accuracy of the localization is considered to be fairly high, as the upper bounds of relative distance errors were less than 41{\%} within 173 m. With the location information, source levels of finless porpoise clicks were estimated to range from 180 to 209 dB re 1 mu Pa pp at 1 m with an average of 197 dB (N=34), which is over 20 dB higher than that estimated previously from animals in enclosed waters. For the four tracked porpoises, two-dimensional swimming trajectories relative to the moving survey boat, absolute swimming speed, and absolute heading direction are deduced by assuming the animal movements are straight and at constant speed in the segment between two consecutive locations.},

abstract = {We examined the possibility that parameters of bottlenose dolphin signature whistles may serve as indicators of stress. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Sarasota Bay, Florida, were recorded during brief capture– release events, which are potentially a source of short-term stress to these dolphins, although no effects of chronic or long-term stress have been observed over the 37+-year duration of the research. Whistles recorded during both brief capture–release and undisturbed, free-ranging conditions were examined to determine whether whistle parameters differ during capture–release versus undisturbed conditions; at the beginning of a capture– release session versus at the end of a session; during an individual's 1st capture–release session versus later capture–release sessions; and when a mother is caught and released with a dependent calf versus without a dependent calf (i.e., she has no dependent calf at the time of capture–release). We examined a variety of acoustic parameters, including whistle rate, number of loops (repetitive elements), maximum and minimum frequency, and loop, interloop, and whistle duration. We found that whistle rate and number of loops were greater during brief capture–release events than during undisturbed conditions; number of loops decreased and loop duration increased over the duration of a capture–release session; whistle rates decreased with number of capture–release sessions; and females caught and released with dependent calves produced whistles with higher maximum frequencies and shorter interloop intervals than when they did not have dependent calves. Thus, whistles appear to have potential as noninvasive indicators of stress in bottlenose dolphins. Further research is warranted in this area, for example by correlating physiological indices to whistle rates under varying levels of stress. Reliable, noninvasive correlates of stress could be used to monitor dolphins in a variety of circumstances, such as during exposure to anthropogenic noise.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in individual differences in animal behaviour. Recent research now suggests that an individual's behaviour, once considered to be plastic, may be more predictable than previously thought. Here, we take advantage of the large number of studies that have estimated the repeatability of various behaviours to evaluate whether there is good evidence for consistent individual differences in behaviour and to answer some outstanding questions about possible factors that can influence repeatability. Specifically, we use meta-analysis to ask whether different types of behaviours were more repeatable than others, and if repeatability estimates depended on taxa, sex, age, field versus laboratory, the number of measures and the interval between measures. Some of the overall patterns that were revealed by this analysis were that repeatability estimates were higher in the field compared to the laboratory and repeatability was higher when the interval between observations was short. Mate preference behaviour was one of the best studied but least repeatable behaviours. Our findings prompt new insights into the relative flexibility of different types of behaviour and offer suggestions for the design and analysis of future research.},

abstract = {Existing methods of dive analysis, developed for fully aquatic animals, tend to focus on frequency of behaviors rather than transitions between them. They, therefore, do not account for the variability of behavior of semiaquatic animals, and the switching between terrestrial and aquatic environments. This is the first study to use hidden Markov models (HMM) to divide dives of a semiaquatic animal into clusters and thus identify the environmental predictors of transition between behavioral modes. We used 18 existing data sets of the dives of 14 American mink (Neovison vison) fitted with time-depth recorders in lowland England. Using HMM, we identified 3 behavioral states (1, temporal cluster of dives; 2, more loosely aggregated diving within aquatic activity; and 3, terminal dive of a cluster or a single, isolated dive). Based on the higher than expected proportion of dives in State 1, we conclude that mink tend to dive in clusters. We found no relationship between temperature and the proportion of dives in each state or between temperature and the rate of transition between states, meaning that in our study area, mink are apparently not adopting different diving strategies at different temperatures. Transition analysis between states has shown that there is no correlation between ambient temperature and the likelihood of mink switching from one state to another, that is, changing foraging modes. The variables provided good discrimination and grouped into consistent states well, indicating promise for further application of HMM and other state transition analyses in studies of semiaquatic animals.},

abstract = {The surface active group (SAG) is the most obvious social interaction of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). SAGs are typically composed of an adult female with two or more males engaged in social behavior near the surface. Distinct calls, believed to be produced by the female, are associated with these groups. Calls recorded from three North Atlantic right whale SAGs and three South Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena australis) SAGs were played back to North Atlantic right whales to determine if these sounds are sufficient to attract males to the groups. Playbacks of gunshot sounds produced by North Atlantic right whales were used as a control stimulus. Thirty-six trials were carried out from 1999 to 2001 in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Whales approached 27 of 31 SAG playbacks and 0 of 5 gunshot playbacks. Where sex was determined (n= 28), all approaches to North Atlantic SAG recordings were by males. Individuals (n= 22) of all age and sex classes approached South Atlantic SAG playbacks. These trials indicate that SAG calls from both populations are sufficient to attract right whales to SAGs and that males and females respond differently to stimuli from the North Atlantic. The difference in response to North and South Atlantic SAG stimuli was unexpected. Novelty, species differences in calls, and different seasonal or behavioral context for the recorded stimuli may be responsible for the differences in response.},

abstract = {Many animals engage in dyadic vocal exchanges. Studying the patterns of vocal output and spatial arrangement of individuals in these interactions can often reveal information concerning their function. Sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, frequently exchange short sequences of clicks, termed codas, in social contexts. We analysed the coda vocalizations of sperm whale social units encountered in two different oceans to test hypotheses about how coda exchanges are organized. We also used a dynamic recording array to estimate the spatial scale of these vocal interactions. Coda production was influenced by the timing and types of codas produced by other unit members, resulting in the production of duet-like sequences of coda exchanges between pairs of whales. Codas were more likely to be made within 2 s of another coda than expected by chance, and whales were more likely to match previously produced codas than expected by chance, although matching appeared to be largely a result of the matching of one particular coda type within each social unit. Patterns of overlapping and matching exchanges did not seem to be correlated with relatedness or social affiliation. These exchanges occurred over a range of spatial scales, and are thus likely to be functional both between whales that are near and between those that are comparatively far from one another. The context of these exchanges, reciprocity in coda overlapping, and the sequencing of exchanges into duet-like chains all suggest that coda overlapping and matching function to reinforce social bonds between whales.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic noise is prevalent across the globe and can exclude birds from otherwise suitable habitat and negatively influence fitness; however, the mechanisms responsible for species' responses to noise are not always clear. One effect of noise is a reduction in effective acoustic communication through acoustic masking, yet some urban songbirds may compensate for masking by noise through altering their songs. Whether this vocal flexibility accounts for species persistence in noisy areas is unknown. Here, we investigated the influence of noise on habitat use and vocal frequency in two suboscine flycatchers using a natural experiment that isolated effects of noise from confounding stimuli common to urban habitats. With increased noise exposure, grey flycatcher (Empidonax wrightii) occupancy declined, but vocal frequency did not change. By contrast, ash-throated flycatcher (Myiarchus cinerascens) occupancy was uninfluenced by noise, but individuals in areas with greater noise amplitudes vocalized at a higher frequency, although the increase ({\^{a}}‰ˆ200 kHz) may only marginally improve communication and may represent a secondary effect from increased vocal amplitude. Even so, the different flycatcher behavioural responses suggest that signal change may help some species persist in noisy areas and prompt important questions regarding which species will cope with an increasingly noisy world.},

Sperm whale recordings collected in the Mediterranean Sea with a towed array and digital tags were used to describe the temporal and spectral characteristics of trumpets. This sound is made of a series of repeated units, around 0.2 s tong, arranged in short sequences lasting between 0.6 s to 3.5 s. Each of these units comprises an amplitude modulated tonal waveform with a complex harmonic structure, and a spectrum composed of a low frequency component at 500 Hz and a mid-frequency component at 3 kHz. The apparent source level could be estimated for one of the trumpets and was estimated to be 172 dB(pp) re: 1 mu Pa at 1m with energy flux density of 147 dB re: 1 mu Pa(2)s.},

abstract = {Abstract: In this paper, we considered the number and diversity of underwater vocalizations given by aquaticbreeding phocids, and two species that copulate both in the water and on ice, in relation to what is known or hypothesized about their mating systems. Underwater recordings made throughout the year by both bearded (Erignathus barbatus) and Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii) seals indicated that most of the vocalizations could be attributed to males and were given almost exclusively during the breeding season. Less extensive studies of other species indicated the same pattern. Thus, for this study, we considered only underwater vocalizations known, or suspected, to be given by adult males during intra-specific agonistic behaviour, defence of territories or access to females, or attraction of females. A one-way ANOVA and linear regression indicated a significant relationship between the numbers of underwater vocalizations given by individual species and their mating systems. A Pearson's correlation analysis discerned the following: the mating system and the number of vocalizations were positively correlated; female gregariousness was positively correlated with the number of underwater vocalizations and geographic variation in vocalizations, but there was no correlation with the duration of lactation. The degree of predation was negatively correlated with the number of vocalizations, geographic variation in vocalizations, and the number of days of lactation. A principal component analysis showed that 66.1{\%} of the variation in this data set was explained by Factor 1, a suite of variables that included mating system, number of underwater vocalizations, intensity of predation, female gregariousness, and geographic variation in vocalizations. The number of days of lactation explained an additional 19.5{\%} of the variability. These results suggest that additional selection pressures, more specific to the ecological circumstances of individual species, also influence the size of the underwater repertoire. The development of a diverse underwater repertoire with geographic variations was consistently associated with the development of population genetic structure and geographic fidelity. Within each category of social system, the species with the greatest number of underwater vocalizations consistently occurred at higher densities during the breeding season than did the species with the lowest vocal diversity. The role of predators on the evolution of social systems is not well known, but could be significant for some species.  Characteristics of the underwater vocalizations of walruses during the breeding season were found to share similar characteristics to phocids occurring at similar densities in similar habitats, suggesting that the most important selection factors influenced both phocids and odobenids similarly. On the basis of the available information from better-studied species, some testable hypotheses are proposed for further investigations of spotted (Phoca largha), Ross (Ommatophoca rossii), Hawaiian monk (Monachus schauinslandi), and ribbon (Phoca fasciata) seals.},

In general, Hispaniolan colubrids were opportunistic predators, but the widespread exploitation of a single prey genus (Anolis) may be unique to the West Indies. Frequently exploited prey species were geographically widespread and generally found at high densities (Osteopilus dominicensis, Anolis coelestinus, A. cybotes, Ameiva chrysolaema). Active foraging snakes (Alsophis, Antillophis) were more euryphagic, while sit-and-wait strategists (Hypsirhynchus, Uromacer oxyrhynchus) were trophically specialized.

abstract = {Animal-borne logging or telemetry devices are widely used for measurements of physiological and movement data from free-living animals. For such measurements to be relevant, however, it is essential that the devices themselves do not affect the data of interest. A recent meta-analysis reported an overall negative effect of these devices on the birds that bear them, i.e. on nesting productivity, clutch size, nest initiation date, offspring quality, body condition, flying ability, foraging behaviours, energy expenditure and survival rate. Method of attachment (harness, collar, glue, anchor, implant, breast-mounted or tailmount) had no influence on the strength of these effects but anchored and implanted transmitters had the highest reported rates of device-induced mortality. Furthermore, external devices, but not internal devices, caused an increase in 'device-induced behaviour' (comfort behaviours such as preening, fluffing and stretching, and unrest activities including unquantifiable 'active' behaviours). These findings suggest that, with the exception of device-induced behaviour, external attachment is preferable to implantation. In the present study we undertake a meta-analysis of 183 estimates of device impact from 39 studies of 36 species of bird designed to explicitly compare the effects of externally attached and surgically implanted devices on a range of traits, including condition, energy expenditure and reproduction. In contrast to a previous study, we demonstrate that externally attached devices have a consistent detrimental effect (i.e. negative influences on body condition, reproduction, metabolism and survival), whereas implanted devices have no consistent effect. We also show that the magnitude of the negative effect of externally attached devices decreases with time. We therefore conclude that device implantation is preferable to external attachment, providing that the risk of mortality associated with the anaesthesia and surgery required for implantation can be mitigated. We recommend that studies employing external devices use devices that can be borne for long periods, and, wherever possible, deploy devices in advance of the time period of interest.},

abstract = {Variation in vocal repertoires within species can result from various processes, from genetic drift to cultural evolution. Studying the detailed nature of such variation over time and space can provide insight into these underlying processes. The temporal stability or otherwise of vocal variants is important information in assessing the possibility of interaction between vocal variation and genetic evolution, while the geographical scale of variation can give useful clues in detailing population structure, thus providing management information. We studied variation in the vocal output of sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, which use short stereotyped click sequences called codas in social contexts, over timescales of up to 6 years and spatial scales of up to 10 000 nautical miles. We found no evidence from either correlation or regression analyses for change over time in the coda output of known social units. We did, however, find evidence for reduced similarity over distances of 200-1000 km. The apparent temporal stability of coda output suggests the possibility of evolutionary interactions. The scale of spatial variation is broadly similar to estimated home range sizes for this species, and the potential for interbreeding over such distances suggests differences between areas may represent local dialects rather than geographical variation through isolation.

abstract = {During their long migrations through the Pacific, northern elephant seals, , never haul out on land and they rarely spend more than a few minutes at a time at the surface. They are almost constantly making repetitive, deep dives, raising the question of when do they rest? One type of dive, the drift dive, characterized by a time-depth profile with a phase of lower than average descent speed is believed to be a resting dive. To examine the behaviour of seals during drift dives, we measured body position and three-dimensional diving paths of six juvenile seals. We found that seals rolled over and sank on their backs during the drift phase, wobbling periodically so that they resembled a falling leaf. This enabled seals to drastically slow their descent rate, possibly so that negatively buoyant seals can rest without ending up in the abyss. This reduces the work required to return to the surface to breath, and allows them time to rest, process food or possibly sleep during the descent phase of these dives where they are probably less susceptible to predation.},

abstract = {Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) produce multipulsed clicks with their hypertrophied nasal complex. The currently accepted view of the sound generation process is based on the click structure measured directly in front of, or behind, the whale where regular interpulse intervals (IPIs) are found between successive pulses in the click. Most sperm whales, however, are recorded with the whale in an unknown orientation with respect to the hydrophone where the multipulse structure and the IPI do not conform to a regular pulse pattern. By combining far-field recordings of usual clicks with acoustic and orientation information measured by a tag on the clicking whale, we analyzed clicks from known aspects to the whale. We show that a geometric model based on the bent horn theory for sound production can explain the varying off-axis multipulse structure. Some of the sound energy that is reflected off the frontal sac radiates directly into the water creating an intermediate pulse p1/2 seen in off-axis recordings. The powerful p1 sonar pulse exits the front of the junk as predicted by the bent-horn model, showing that the junk of the sperm whale nasal complex is both anatomically and functionally homologous to the melon of smaller toothed whales.

abstract = {Toadfishes (Teleostei: Batrachoididae) are one of the best-studied groups for understanding vocal communication in fishes. However, sounds have only been recorded from a low proportion of taxa within the family. Here, we used quantitative bioacoustic, morphological and phylogenetic methods to characterize vocal behavior and mechanisms in the three-spined toadfish, Batrachomoeus trispinosus. B. trispinosus produced two types of sound: long-duration `hoots' and short-duration `grunts' that were multiharmonic, amplitude and frequency modulated, with a dominant frequency below 1 kHz. Grunts and hoots formed four major classes of calls. Hoots were typically produced in succession as trains, while grunts occurred either singly or as grunt trains. Aside from hoot trains, grunts and grunt trains, a fourth class of calls consisted of single grunts with acoustic beats, apparently not previously reported for individuals from any teleost taxon. Beats typically had a predominant frequency around 2 kHz with a beat frequency around 300 Hz. Vocalizations also exhibited diel and lunar periodicities. Spectrographic cross-correlation and principal coordinates analysis of hoots from five other toadfish species revealed that B. trispinosus hoots were distinct. Unlike any other reported fish, B. trispinosus had a bilaterally divided swimbladder, forming two separate swimbladders. Phylogenetic analysis suggested B. trispinosus was a relatively basal batrachoidid, and the swimbladder and acoustic beats were independently derived. The swimbladder in B. trispinosus demonstrates that toadfishes have undergone a diversification of peripheral sonic mechanisms, which may be responsible for the concomitant innovations in vocal communication, namely the individual production of acoustic beats as reported in some tetrapods.},

abstract = {We developed an acoustic tag, called MOSART (MObile Submersible Acoustic Recorder of Transients), for recording directional social pulses produced by a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). The tag was attached to the dorsal fin of two dolphins by means of suction cups. Two adult bottlenose dolphins at the Kolm{\aa}rdens Djurpark, Sweden, were trained to carry the tag comfortably through a desensitising program. The tag included two envelope click-detectors, each with a narrow bandpass filter, centred at 120 and 70 kHz, respectively. The duration of the original pulses and their relative amplitude within the two filter frequency bands was retained. The amplitude differences between the two filter bands reflected changes in the source frequency spectrum and/or the position of the tag hydrophone in the incoming sound beam. The tag recorded "echolocation click trains," "slow and irregular pulses," and "pulse bursts" with varying amounts of energy in both frequency bands. The peak amplitude and duration of clicks in "echolocation click trains" and in "slow and irregular pulses" were logged correctly; however, the tag recorder had more difficulties in handling the complex pulses in the aggressive "pulse bursts," where the duration of the individual pulses could not be determined. Still, the amplitude and the pulse repetition rate could be measured. The possible impact of the tag was investigated by analysing the dolphin's behaviours (12 categories), sounds (3 categories), preferred location in the pool, and respiration intervals. Only four of the behaviours and one preferred location in the pool showed significant differences among pre-tag baselines, tag periods, and post-tag follow-ups, suggesting that the tag had only a minor impact on the dolphin. We describe and discuss the tag and its capacity to record different pulsed sounds.

abstract = {Empirical research on human and non-human primates suggests that communication sounds express the intensity of an emotional state of a signaller. In the present study, we have examined communication sounds during induced social interactions of a monogamous mammal, the tree shrew. To signal their unwillingness to mate, female tree shrews show defensive threat displays towards unfamiliar males paralleled by acoustically variable squeaks. We assumed that the distance between interacting partners as well as the behavior of the male towards the female indicates the intensity of perceived social threat and thereby the arousal state of a female. To explore this hypothesis we analyzed dynamic changes in communication sounds uttered during induced social interactions between a female and an unfamiliar male. Detailed videographic and sound analyzes revealed that the arousal state predicted variations in communication sound structure reliably. Both, a decrease of distance and a male approaching the female led to an increase in fundamental frequency and repetition rate of syllables. These findings support comparable results in human and non-human primates and suggest that common coding rules in communication sounds govern acoustic conflict regulation in mammals.},

abstract = {In most areas, estimating the presence and distribution of cryptic marine mammal species, such as beaked whales, is extremely difficult using traditional observational techniques such as ship-based visual line transect surveys. Because acoustic methods permit detection of animals underwater, at night, and in poor weather conditions, passive acoustic observation has been used increasingly often over the last decade to study marine mammal distribution, abundance, and movements, as well as for mitigation of potentially harmful anthropogenic effects. However, there is demand for new, cost-effective tools that allow scientists to monitor areas of interest autonomously with high temporal and spatial resolution in near-real time. Here we describe an autonomous underwater vehicle – a glider – equipped with an acoustic sensor and onboard data processing capabilities to passively scan an area for marine mammals in near-real time. The glider was tested extensively off the west coast of the Island of Hawai'i, USA. The instrument covered approximately 390 km during three weeks at sea and collected a total of 194 h of acoustic data. Detections of beaked whales were successfully reported to shore in near-real time. Manual analysis of the recorded data revealed a high number of vocalizations of delphinids and sperm whales. Furthermore, the glider collected vocalizations of unknown origin very similar to those made by known species of beaked whales. The instrument developed here can be used to cost-effectively screen areas of interest for marine mammals for several months at a time. The near-real-time detection and reporting capabilities of the glider can help to protect marine mammals during potentially harmful anthropogenic activities such as seismic exploration for sub-sea fossil fuels or naval sonar exercises. Furthermore, the glider is capable of under-ice operation, allowing investigation of otherwise inaccessible polar environments that are critical habitats for many endangered marine mammal species.},

abstract = {The finite element modeling (FEM) space reported here contains the head of a simulated whale based on CT data sets as well as physical measurements of sound-propagation characteristics of actual tissue samples. Simulated sound sources placed inside and outside of an adult male Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) reveal likely sound propagation pathways into and out of the head. Two separate virtual sound sources that were located at the left and right phonic lips produced beams that converged just outside the head. This result supports the notion that dual sound sources can interfere constructively to form a biologically useful and, in fact, excellent sonar beam in front of the animal. The most intriguing FEM results concern pathways by which sounds reach the ears. The simulations reveal a previously undescribed 'gular pathway' for sound reception in Ziphius. Propagated sound pressure waves enter the head from below and between the lower jaws, pass through an opening created by the absence of the medial bony wall of the posterior mandibles, and continue toward the bony ear complexes through the internal mandibular fat bodies. This new pathway has implications for understanding the evolution of underwater hearing in odontocetes. Our model also provides evidence for receive beam directionality, off-axis acoustic shadowing and a plausible mechanism for the long-standing orthodox sound reception pathway in odontocetes. The techniques developed for this study can be used to study acoustic perturbation in a wide variety of marine organisms.},

abstract = {Most harbour porpoises found dead on the north-east coast of Scotland show signs of attack by sympatric bottlenose dolphins? but the reason(s) for these violent interactions remain(s) unclear. Post-mortem examinations of stranded bottlenose dolphins indicate that five out of eight young calves from this same area were also killed by bottlenose dolphins. These data, together with direct observations of an aggressive interaction between an adult bottlenose dolphin and a dead bottlenose dolphin calf, provide strong evidence for infanticide in this population. The similarity in the size range of harbour porpoises and dolphin calves that showed signs of attack by bottlenose dolphins suggests chat previously reported interspecific interactions could be related to this infanticidal behaviour. These findings appear to provide the first evidence of infanticide in cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises). We suggest that infanticide must be considered as a factor shaping sociality in this and other species of cetaceans, and may have serious consequences for the viability of small populations.},

abstract = {The extreme body size of blue whales requires a high energy intake and therefore demands efficient foraging strategies. As an obligate lunge feeder on aggregations of small zooplankton, blue whales engulf a large volume of prey-laden water in a single, rapid gulp. The efficiency of this feeding mechanism is strongly dependent on the amount of prey that can be captured during each lunge, yet food resources tend to be patchily distributed in both space and time. Here, we measured the three-dimensional kinematics and foraging behaviour of blue whales feeding on krill, using suction-cup attached multi-sensor tags. Our analyses revealed 360° rolling lunge-feeding manoeuvres that reorient the body and position the lower jaws so that a krill patch can be engulfed with the whale's body inverted. We also recorded these rolling behaviours when whales were in a searching mode in between lunges, suggesting that this behaviour also enables the whale to visually process the prey field and maximize foraging efficiency by surveying for the densest prey aggregations. These results reveal the complex manoeuvrability that is required for large rorqual whales to exploit prey patches and highlight the need to fully understand the three-dimensional interactions between predator and prey in the natural environment.},

abstract = {Auditory brainstem response (ABR) and standard behavioral methods were compared by measuring in-air audiograms for an adult female harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Behavioral audiograms were obtained using two techniques: the method of constant stimuli and the staircase method. Sensitivity was tested from 0.250 to 30 kHz. The seal showed good sensitivity from 6 to 12 kHz.[best sensitivity 8.1 dB (re,20 muPa(2).s) RMS at 8 kHz]. The staircase method yielded thresholds that were lower by 10 dB on average than the method of constant stimuli. ABRs were recorded at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 22 kHz and showed a similar best range (8-16 kHz). ABR thresholds averaged 5.7 dB higher than behavioral thresholds at 2, 4, and 8 kHz. ABRs were at least 7-dB lower at 16 kHz, and approximately 3 dB higher at 22 kHz. The better sensitivity of ABRs at higher frequencies could have reflected differences in the seal's behavior during ABR testing and/or bandwidth characteristics of test stimuli. These results agree with comparisons of ABR and behavioral methods performed in other recent studies and indicate that ABR methods represent a good alternative for estimating hearing range and sensitivity in pinnipeds, particularly when time is a critical factor and animals are untrained.

abstract = {R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} / Abstract A parametric model estimation is presented for a number of echo location clicks of Thrsiops truncatus and Sousa chinensis. Our candidate for the signal-fitting procedure is the Gabor elementary signal; a Gaussian-enveloped harmonic oscillation as proposed by Gabor (1947). Application of this wave form is indicated by the low product of time duration and frequency bandwidth, which reaches the theoretical lower bound in the case of the Gabor signal. Examples are taken from a portfolio of delplunid sonar signals collected over the past 16 years by the Delft Dolphin Research Team. The portfolio covers echo location signals recorded in restricted environments and from free-ranging dolphins. The Sousa chinensis sonar click has not been previously described. Agreement of the actual wave form and the proposed model on an energy basis leaves us with a figure of merit down to 0.3{\%} for a Tursiops echolocation signal. The possible occurrence of internal reverberations and their influence on the description of the sonar click are incorporated in the overall model forming. },

abstract = {Abstract  A thorough understanding of communication requires an evaluation of both the signaler and receiver. Most analyses of prey–predator communication are incomplete because they examine only the behavior of the prey. Predators in these systems may be understudied because they are perceived as less tractable research subjects, due to their more cryptic hunting behaviors and secretive lifestyles. For example, research on interactions between rodents and rattlesnakes has focused on the behavior of rodent signalers, while responses of snakes have been virtually unexamined. Rattlesnakes are ambush predators, and capture rodents by waiting at foraging sites for long periods of time. In this study, I take advantage of the sedentary nature of this foraging strategy and use fixed videography to record natural encounters between timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) and their prey. Three different prey species were found to exhibit conspicuous visual displays to snakes, both when snakes were actively foraging, and when they were basking. After receiving displays, foraging snakes left their ambush sites and moved long distances before locating subsequent ambush sites, indicating that they responded to displays by abandoning attempts to ambush prey in the vicinity of signalers. This study represents the first quantitative analysis of the response of free-ranging snakes to signals from their prey, and elucidates a technique by which such quantitative data can be more easily obtained.},

In the field, the context of signals was noted whenever possible. This included the behaviour of the signaller and that of its nearest neighbour. Frequency and temporal variables, measured directly from sonograms, were analyzed using a combination of principal components analysis and cluster analysis. Three major classes of sounds containing 5 call types were suggested by the cluster analysis. Variation occurs in the structure of calls both within and between call classes. Sounds that were created using the hood and septum both under water and in air, as well as a variety of underwater clicks and knocks, were distinct from voiced, airborne calls. Not surprisingly, most acoustic signals were used in agonistic (79{\%}) or sexual (12{\%}) situations during the reproductive period.},

abstract = {Most of our knowledge of biodiversity and its causes in the deep-sea benthos derives from regional-scale sampling studies of the macrofauna. Improved sampling methods and the expansion of investigations into a wide variety of habitats have revolutionized our understanding of the deep sea. Local species diversity shows clear geographic variation on spatial scales of 100-1000 km. Recent sampling programs have revealed unexpected complexity in community structure at the landscape level that is associated with large-scale oceanographic processes and their environmental consequences. We review the relationships between variation in local species diversity and the regional-scale phenomena of boundary constraints, gradients of productivity, sediment heterogeneity, oxygen availability, hydrodynamic regimes, and catastrophic physical disturbance. We present a conceptual model of how these interdependent environmental factors shape regional-scale variation in local diversity. Local communities in the deep sea may be composed of species that exist as metapopulations whose regional distribution depends on a balance among global-scale, landscape-scale, and small-scale dynamics. Environmental gradients may form geographic patterns of diversity by influencing local processes such as predation, resource partitioning, competitive exclusion, and facilitation that determine species coexistence. The measurement of deep-sea species diversity remains a vital issue in comparing geographic patterns and evaluating their potential causes. Recent assessments of diversity using species accumulation curves with randomly pooled samples confirm the often-disputed claim that the deep sea supports higher diversity than the continental shelf. However, more intensive quantitative sampling is required to fully characterize the diversity of deep-sea sediments, the most extensive habitat on Earth. Once considered to be constant, spatially uniform, and isolated, deep-sea sediments are now recognized as a dynamic, richly textured environment that is inextricably linked to the global biosphere. Regional studies of the last two decades provide the empirical background necessary to formulate and test specific hypotheses of causality by controlled sampling designs and experimental approaches.},

abstract = {Acoustic behaviors are widespread among diverse fish taxa but mechanisms of sound production are known from relatively few species, vary widely and convergent mechanisms are poorly known. We examined the sound production mechanism in the pyramid butterflyfish, Hemitaurichthys polylepis, a member of the socially and ecologically diverse reef fish family Chaetodontidae. In the field, fish produce pulse trains at dusk during social interactions that are probably related to mate attraction and courtship. In laboratory experiments, sound production was synchronized to high-speed video to determine body movement associated with sound generation. In addition, electromyography (EMG) recordings tested the activity of six candidate muscles. Fish produced individual pulses with a mean peak frequency of 97 Hz in rapid succession. EMG experiments show that anterior hypaxial muscles contract at high bilaterally synchronous rates (up to 120 Hz) in near perfect association with rapid inward buckling visible outside the body over the anterior swim bladder. Muscle activity often showed EMG doublets that occurred within the time of a single sound pulse but was not sustained. Buckling and sound pulse rates correlated strongly (R2{\{}approx{\}}1.00) and sound pulse rate measured over two successive pulses (maximum of 38 pulses s-1) was lower than muscle firing rate. These results show that the extrinsic swim bladder muscles of pyramid butterflyfish involve single contractions that produce pulses in a manner similar to distantly related teleosts, but involve a novel doublet motor-neuron firing pattern. Thus, the sound production mechanism in pyramid butterflyfish is likely convergent with several percomorph taxa and divergent from the related chaetodontid genus Forcipiger.},

abstract = {Coevolution between senders and receivers is expected to produce a close match between signal design and sensory biology. We evaluated this hypothesis in songbirds by comparing aspects of acoustic signal space with the frequency range of auditory sensitivity and temporal resolution in tufted titmice, Baeolophus bicolor; house sparrows, Passer domesticus; and white-breasted nuthatches, Sitta carolinensis. Auditory measurements were made electrophysiologically from the scalp using two classes of auditory-evoked potentials: the auditory brain-stem response (ABR) and the envelope-following response (EFR). ABRs to tone-burst stimuli indicated maximum sensitivity from 2.2 to 3.2 kHz in all species, but 12-14 dB greater sensitivity in titmice than in sparrows and nuthatches at 6.4 kHz (the highest frequency tested). Modulation rate transfer functions based on EFRs to amplitude-modulated tones suggested greater temporal resolution in titmice and sparrows than in nuthatches. Conservation of the frequency range of maximum sensitivity across species resulted in a mismatch with the dominant frequency of song in sparrows. The mismatch may reflect auditory constraints coupled with selection for high-frequency song and relaxed selection for a close match between sender and receiver due to small territory size. Consistent with coevolution between senders and receivers, high-frequency sensitivity varied with the maximum frequency of species-specific vocalizations, whereas temporal resolution varied with the maximum rate of envelope periodicity. Enhanced high-frequency sensitivity of the titmouse may reflect a specialization for processing high-frequency communication signals such as alarm calls.},

abstract = {Aquatic foraging is a fundamental component of the behavior of a number of small mammals, yet comprehensive observations of diving are often difficult to obtain under natural circumstances. Semiaquatic mammals, having evolved to exploit prey in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, are generally not as well adapted for diving (or for life in the water) as are fully aquatic species. Because dive ability also tends to increase with body size, small, semiaquatic mammals are presumed to have fairly limited dive ability. Nevertheless, diving plays an important role in food acquisition for many such species. We used time–depth recorders (TDRs) to measure and describe the dive performance of 9 female and 5 male free-living American mink (Neovison vison; body mass approximately 1 kg) on lowland rivers in the southern United Kingdom. We recorded dives up to 2.96 m deep (maximum depth X¯  =  1.82 m) and up to 57.9 s in duration (maximum duration X¯  =  37.2 s). Dive duration was approximately 40{\%} of that predicted by allometry for all air-breathing diving vertebrates (as might be expected for a small, semiaquatic animal) but was twice as long as previously measured for mink in captivity. Mink performed up to 189 dives per day (X¯  =  35.7 dives/day), mostly during daylight, and spent a maximum of 38.4 minutes diving per day (X¯  =  7.6 min/day). Some individuals maintained particularly high diving rates over the coldest months, suggesting that the benefits of aquatic foraging in winter outweigh the costs of heat loss. We observed a number of very shallow dives (depth approximately 0.3 m) of particularly long duration (up to 30 s). The function of these dives is currently unknown, but possibilities include searching for prey, travelling, or avoidance of threats. There is only 1 other study of which we are aware that presents detailed measurements of dive performance in a small, shallow-diving, semiaquatic mammal.},

abstract = {Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) being on top of the food chain are considered as a flagship species of Chilika. These cetaceans produce characteristic echolocation pulses that make them acoustically visible, night or day. Acoustic-based survey methods are found to be indispensable for surveying porpoises and dolphins in coastal precincts. This paper reports the first such collaborative attempt in Chilika by applying acoustic survey technology based on the design of an innovative compact and portable acoustic survey device designed for observation of groups of small cetaceans. The acoustic sensor system is housed in a "bird-cage" structure containing 3 hydrophones forming a main linear array, together with two more hydrophones forming a small 3-element triangle array with the central hydrophone, in a plane perpendicular to the linear array axis. It weighs 25kg and is 3.6m long, 30cm. in diameter, and can be deployed either vertically or horizontally with buoys and a weight. A high-speed multi-channel data acquisition system records the dolphin click sounds from all hydrophones. Signal processing algorithms have been developed for automatic detection and discrimination of echolocation clicks from other underwater sounds, localization of sound sources, and tracking individual animals. The device has previously been tested in vertical mode in a quasi-natural environment with a group of bottlenose dolphins that has confirmed its capability to precisely track several vocalizing animals. The depth of the Chilika lagoon in the dolphin habitat can be as shallow as 1.5m. Thus, the array has to be deployed in horizontal mode, which enables it to provide very good lateral resolution in the broadside direction. This paper reports the first results of using this array in shallow water conditions. Movements of several Irrawaddy dolphins have been observed very clearly.},

abstract = {Animal behavioral patterns can help us understand physiological and ecological constraints on animals and its influence on fitness. The surfacing patterns of aquatic air-breathing mammals constitute a behavioral pattern that has evolved as a trade-off between the need to replenish oxygen stores at the surface and the need to conduct other activities underwater. This study aims to better understand the surfacing pattern of a marine top predator, the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), by investigating how their dive duration and surfacing pattern changes across their activity range. Activities were classified into resting, traveling, surface feeding and foraging at depth. For each activity, we classified dives into short and long dives and then estimated the temporal dependence between dive types. We found that minke whales modified their surfacing pattern in an activity-specific manner, both by changing the expression of their dives (i.e. density distribution) and the temporal dependence (transition probability) between dive types. As the depth of the prey layer increased between activities, the surfacing pattern of foraging whales became increasingly structured, going from a pattern dominated by long dives, when feeding at the surface, to a pattern where isolated long dives were followed by an increasing number of breaths (i.e. short dives), when the whale was foraging at depth. A similar shift in surfacing pattern occurred when prey handling time (inferred from surface corralling maneuvers) increased for surface feeding whales. The surfacing pattern also differed between feeding and non-feeding whales. Resting whales did not structure their surfacing pattern, while traveling whales did, possibly as a way to minimize cost of transport. Our results also suggest that minke whales might balance their oxygen level over multiple, rather than single, dive cycles.},

Such reports are interpreted flexibly as appropriate in various contexts of application. With the usual normality assumption, such reports may be read as representing confidence intervals or limits at the various confidence levels, and this omnibus character largely accounts for the convenience and flexibility of such reports and interpretations. For estimators not normally distributed, a formal analogue of such reports is provided by confidence curves, which are estimates of an omnibus form incorporating confidence intervals and limits at various levels. The definition and computation of such estimates, and their graphical representation and interpretation, are discussed and illustrated by an example.},

abstract = {Chronic social stress diverts energy away from growth, reproduction and immunity, and is thus a potential driver of population dynamics. However, the effects of social stress on demographic density dependence remain largely overlooked in ecological theory. Here we combine behavioural experiments, physiology and population modelling to show in a top predator (pike ) that social stress alone may be a primary driver of demographic density dependence. Doubling pike density in experimental ponds under controlled prey availability did not significantly change prey intake by pike (i.e. did not significantly change interference or exploitative competition), but induced a neuroendocrine stress response reflecting a size-dependent dominance hierarchy, depressed pike energetic status and lowered pike body growth rate by 23 per cent. Assuming fixed size-dependent survival and fecundity functions parameterized for the Windermere (UK) pike population, stress-induced smaller body size shifts age-specific survival rates and lowers age-specific fecundity, which in Leslie matrices projects into reduced population rate of increase () by 37{\^{a}}€“56{\%}. Our models also predict that social stress flattens elasticity profiles of {\^{I}}» to age-specific survival and fecundity, thus making population persistence more dependent on old individuals. Our results suggest that accounting for non-consumptive social stress from competitors and predators is necessary to accurately understand, predict and manage food-web dynamics.},

abstract = {Beaked whales are among the most diverse yet least understood groups of marine mammals. A diverse set of mostly anthropogenic threats necessitates improvement in our ability to assess population status for this cryptic group. The Southwest Fisheries Science Center (NOAA) conducted six ship line-transect cetacean abundance surveys in the California Current off the contiguous western United States between 1991 and 2008. We used a Bayesian hidden-process modeling approach to estimate abundance and population trends of beaked whales using sightings data from these surveys. We also compiled records of beaked whale stranding events (3 genera, at least 8 species) on adjacent beaches from 1900 to 2012, to help assess population status of beaked whales in the northern part of the California Current. Bayesian posterior summaries for trend parameters provide strong evidence of declining beaked whale abundance in the study area. The probability of negative trend for Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) during 1991-2008 was 0.84, with 1991 and 2008 estimates of 10771 (CV = 0.51) and ≈7550 (CV = 0.55), respectively. The probability of decline for Mesoplodon spp. (pooled across species) was 0.96, with 1991 and 2008 estimates of 2206 (CV = 0.46) and 811 (CV = 0.65). The mean posterior estimates for average rate of decline were 2.9{\%} and 7.0{\%} per year. There was no evidence of abundance trend for Baird's beaked whale (Berardius bairdii), for which annual abundance estimates in the survey area ranged from ≈900 to 1300 (CV≈1.3). Stranding data were consistent with the survey results. Causes of apparent declines are unknown. Direct impacts of fisheries (bycatch) can be ruled out, but impacts of anthropogenic sound (e.g., naval active sonar) and ecosystem change are plausible hypotheses that merit investigation.},

abstract = {Abstract  Juvenile and adult reef fishes often undergo migration, ontogenic habitat shifts, and nocturnal foraging movements. The orientation cues used for these behaviours are largely unknown. In this study, the use of sound as an orientation cue guiding the nocturnal movements of adult and juvenile reef fishes at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef was examined. The first experiment compared the movements of fishes to small patch reefs where reef noise was broadcast, with those to silent reefs. No significant responses were found in the 79 adults that were collected, but the 166 juveniles collected showed an increased diversity each morning on the reefs with broadcast noise, and significantly greater numbers of juveniles from three taxa (Apogonidae, Gobiidae and Pinguipedidae) were collected from reefs with broadcast noise. The second experiment compared the movement of adult and juvenile fishes to reefs broadcasting high ({\textgreater}570 Hz), or low ({\textless}570 Hz) frequency reef noise, or to silent reefs. Of the 122 adults collected, the highest diversity was seen at the low frequency reefs; and adults from two families (Gobiidae and Blenniidae) preferred these reefs. A similar trend was observed in the 372 juveniles collected, with higher diversity at the reefs with low frequency noises. This preference was seen in the juvenile apogonids; however, juvenile gobiids were attracted to both high and low sound treatments equally, and juvenile stage Acanthuridae preferred the high frequency noises. This evidence that juvenile and adult reef fishes orientate with respect to the soundscape raises important issues for management, conservation and the protection of sound cues used in natural behaviour.},

abstract = {Abstract: The underwater vocalizations of Atlantic walruses, Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus, were recorded during the breeding season at a polynya in the Penny Strait region of the Canadian High Arctic from 1983 to 1989. Mature male walruses emitted two predominant song types, a coda song and a diving vocalization song (DV song). These consisted of a short and long variation of the coda song and a short variation of the DV song that was heard sporadically. The basic structure, organization and temporal characteristics of these song types and variations did not change over the study period. Most males (78{\%}) breeding at the polynya emitted either coda or DV songs 75{\%} of the time that they were engaged in vocal display behaviour. The remainder of the repertoire was comprised of either intermediate songs where the males switched from one song type to the other or aberrant songs that were not recognizable as either song type. In 1988 and 1989, there were significant year-to-year changes in the predominant song type emitted by males in the polynya. It is not certain whether new males moving into the polynya, or perhaps more dominant resident males, influence which song type is emitted during a particular breeding season. Walruses significantly shortened the total duration of their songs and spent more time at the surface when they were attending a herd of females or singing near females as compared to when they sang alone. The duration of singing bouts for some males varied from 8 to at least 65 h and there was a tendency for song type and song duration to vary as the bout progressed. The singing behaviour of male walruses appears to reinforce dominance status in the absence of fighting, suggesting that intra-sexual selection has been important in the evolution of song.},

abstract = {The adaptive significance of play is one of ethology's greatest enigmas, yet few of the many hypotheses advanced to explain play have ever been tested. I evaluated an aspect of the social-bonding hypothesis, which proposes that social play strengthens long-term bonds between individuals, enhancing future alliances. Using data from a wild population, I tested five predictions arising from the hypothesis that meerkats, Suricata suricatta, use play to strengthen ties with potential dispersal partners. Meerkats did not favour play with the most appropriate potential partners, that is, they did not prefer their own sex (although they disperse with animals of the same sex only) nor did they strive to play with younger animals (that they could dominate in a future group) or avoid playing with older animals (that they could not). Frequency of play was unrelated to the size of subsequent dispersal parties, or the likelihood of males undertaking prospecting forays with companions, and preferred playmates were not favoured as prospecting partners. Although meerkats preferred to disperse with littermates (and littermates were strongly favoured in play), they played no more frequently with their future dispersal partners than with matched controls with which they did not disperse. I conclude that the strengthening of long-term bonds between potential dispersal partners is not the function of social play in meerkats. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {This study was the first phase in a long-term investigation of the importance of low-frequency sound in the aquatic life of northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris. By attaching acoustic recording packages to the backs of six translocated juveniles, the aim was to determine the predominant frequencies and sound levels impinging on them, and whether they actively vocalize underwater on their return to their rookery at Ano Nuevo, California, from deep water in Monterey Bay. All packages contained a Sony digital audio tape recorder encased in an aluminum housing with an external hydrophone. Flow noise was minimized by potting the hydrophone in resin to the housing and orienting it posteriorly. The diving pattern of four seals was recorded with a separate time-depth recorder or a time-depth-velocity recorder. Good acoustic records were obtained from three seals. Flow noise was positively correlated with swim speed, but not so high as to mask most low-frequency sounds in the environment. Dominant frequencies of noise impinging on the seals were in the range 20-200 Hz. Transient signals recorded from the seals included snapping shrimp, cetacean vocalizations, boat noise, small explosive charges, and seal swim strokes, but no seal vocalizations were detected. During quiet intervals at the surface between dives, the acoustic record was dominated by respiration and signals that appeared to be heartbeats. This study demonstrates the feasibility of recording sounds from instruments attached to free-ranging seals, and in doing so, studying their behavioral and physiological response to fluctuations in ambient sounds.

abstract = {Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are deep-diving predators foraging in meso- and bathypelagic ecosystems off the continental shelves. To investigate the ecophysiological and communicative function of various click types from male sperm whales in a high-latitude habitat, we deployed a large-aperture array of calibrated hydrophones off northern Norway (N69, E15). Data show that sperm whales in this habitat produce three click types: usual clicks, creak clicks and, occasionally, slow clicks. Usual clicks and creak clicks exhibit short duration, profound directionality and a frequency content suited for echolocation on meso- and bathypelagic fish and squids. The acoustic properties and low repetition rate of usual clicks are suited for long-range echolocation, whereas creak clicks have properties equivalent to signals in buzzes, the terminating pulse trains known from echolocating bats during prey capture. From these source parameters and the high acoustic activity during foraging dives, it is concluded that echolocation is an important sensory cue in prey location. Sound pressure levels of creak clicks and usual clicks measured off the acoustic axis suggest that sperm whales may be subjected to eavesdropping by conspecifics, thereby conveying information about food aggregations at estimated ranges of 6 km for creak clicks and 16 km for usual clicks. Slow clicks exhibit low directionality, low-frequency emphasis and a reduced repetition rate, suggesting that this click type is more suited for communication than for echolocation. Slow clicks can be detected by submerged conspecifics at ranges up to 60 km. Thus, sperm whales producing slow clicks may represent an odontocete species that utilizes long-range sound communication.},

abstract = {From March 2005 to March 2006, the presence of the finless porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides in the Kanmon Strait, Japan was monitored using a stationary acoustic event recording device. A stereo acoustic event recorder (A-tag) recorded biosonar signals as well as sound source directions, which can be used to count the number of echolocating porpoises within a distance of 126 m. During 75 days of effective observation, 37 porpoises were detected acoustically. On average, one individual was detected every two days. Most of the finless porpoises appeared at night, and no porpoises were observed from 12:00 to 18:00 hours. Shipping traffic observed using the same acoustic system showed trends opposite to that of finless porpoise during the daytime. The tidal current did not affect the presence of the animals (up to 5.2 knots). However, porpoises were suggested to swim along the current direction. Finless porpoises appeared to be isolated and used relatively long-range sonar during the observations, suggesting that the porpoises passed through the Kanmon Strait rather than searched for prey.},

abstract = {Interannual, seasonal, and regional variation in the diet of porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, in Scottish (UK) waters was studied using stomach contents of animals stranded between 1992 and 2003. Most samples came from the east coast (including many porpoises killed by bottlenose dolphins), with smaller numbers from the west coast and from Shetland. The most important prey types, in terms of contribution by number and mass, were whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and sand eels (Ammodytidae). Multivariate analysis confirmed the existence of regional, seasonal, and interannual variation in diet, as well as differences (i.e., biases) related to cause of death. These differences were further explored using univariate analyses. Sand eels were more important in the summer months (quarters 2 and 3) and on the east coast, whereas gadids were more important in winter and in the Shetland area. Some, but not all, observed trends in the numerical importance and size of prey taken were consistent with trends in abundance and size of fish taken during research trawl surveys. There was some evidence that porpoises {\textless}1 yr old took more gobies (Gobiidae) and shrimps than did older porpoises. Clupeids (herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus) formed a relatively small proportion of the diet, but their importance varied from year to year. Although possible methodological biases prevent firm conclusions, it appears that the importance of clupeids in porpoise diet may have decreased since the 1960s, mirroring the decline in North Sea herring abundance. The recovery of the North Sea herring stock in recent years is not as yet reflected in porpoise diet.},

abstract = {Detecting objects in their paths is a fundamental perceptional function of moving organisms. Potential risks and rewards, such as prey, predators, conspecifics or non-biological obstacles, must be detected so that an animal can modify its behaviour accordingly. However, to date few studies have considered how animals in the wild focus their attention. Dolphins and porpoises are known to actively use sonar or echolocation. A newly developed miniature data logger attached to a porpoise allows for individual recording of acoustical search efforts and inspection distance based on echolocation. In this study, we analysed the biosonar behaviour of eight free-ranging finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides) and demonstrated that these animals inspect the area ahead of them before swimming silently into it. The porpoises inspected distances up to 77 in, whereas their swimming distance without using sonar was less than 20 in. The inspection distance was long enough to ensure a wide safety margin before facing real risks or rewards. Once a potential prey item was detected, porpoises adjusted their inspection distance from the remote target throughout their approach.},

abstract = {Dolphin brain size with respect to body size ranks between that of apes and humans. The hypertrophic auditory structures, the large cerebrum with extended gyrification and the highly cognitive capabilities of toothed whales seem to be in paradoxical contrast to their thin neocortex with a plesiomorphic or paedomorphic cytoarchitecture. The total number of neurons in the delphinid neocortex is comparable to that of the chimpanzee (Primates), but, in relation to body weight, in the magnitude Of the hedgehog (Insectivora) neocortex since cetaceans may be able to obtain larger body sizes than terrestrial mammals due to reduced gravitational effects in water. During evolution, dolphins may have increased the computational performance of their cytoarchitectonically 'simple' neocortex by a multiplication of relevant structures (resulting in a hypertrophic surface area) instead of increasing its complexity. Based on this hypothesis, I suggest that the evolution of the large dolphin brain was possible due to a combination of different prerequisites based on adaptations to the aquatic environment including the sonar system. The latter facilitated a successful feeding strategy to support an increased metabolic turnover of the brain and led to a hypertrophic auditory system. Moreover, the rudimentary pelvic girdle did not limit brain size at birth. These adaptations favoured the evolutionary size increase of the cerebral cortex in dolphins facilitating highly cognitive capabilities as well as precise and rapid sound processing using a 'simple' kind of neocortical cytoarchitecture.},

Click stimuli were presented at peak-peak equivalent sound pressure levels of 117-118 dB re: 20 microPa. Three positive peaks (P1-P3) and two negative peaks (N4 and N5) were observed in the AEP. Response latencies were longer than previously observed in a 1.8 yr old seal and the maximum peak-peak amplitude was comparatively reduced by more than 60{\%}. The inverse relationship between size and AEP amplitude will likely require increased averaging with larger subjects and possibly modifications to electrode placement and design in order to increase the quality of recorded evoked responses.},

abstract = {The demand for renewable energy has led to construction of offshore wind farms with high-power turbines, and many more wind farms are being planned for the shallow waters of the world's marine habitats. The growth of offshore wind farms has raised concerns about their impact on the marine environment. Marine mammals use sound for foraging, orientation and communication and are therefore possibly susceptible to negative effects of man-made noise generated from constructing and operating large offshore wind turbines. This paper reviews the existing literature and assesses zones of impact from different noise-generating activities in conjunction with wind farms on 4 representative shallow-water species of marine mammals. Construction involves many types of activities that can generate high sound pressure levels, and pile-driving seems to be the noisiest of all. Both the literature and modeling show that pile-driving and other activities that generate intense impulses during construction are likely to disrupt the behavior of marine mammals at ranges of many kilometers, and that these activities have the potential to induce hearing impairment at close range. The reported noise levels from operating wind turbines are low, and are unlikely to impair hearing in marine mammals. The impact zones for marine mammals from operating wind turbines depend on the low-frequency hearing-abilities of the species in question, on sound-propagation conditions, and on the presence of other noise sources such as shipping. The noise impact on marine mammals is more severe during the construction of wind farms than during their operation.},

abstract = {Many animals communicate in situations that make it difficult to discriminate a species' signals from those of others. Consequently, coexisting species usually have signals that differ by more than the minimum required to prevent overlap in acoustic features. These gaps between signals might facilitate detection and discrimination of degraded signals in noisy natural conditions. If so, perception of signals should have broader scope than production. We investigated this possibility by studying song production and perception of two species of birds in an especially noisy environment, the Amazonian dawn chorus. With software developed for this study, we digitally synthesized songs of two species, as well as intermediate versions of their songs. Experimental playbacks of these synthesized songs to individuals of both species confirmed that perception (as indicated by responses) was broader than production of songs. We propose that broader perception than production of song promotes communication in noisy situations and limits the similarity between signals of coexisting species.},

abstract = {Underwater vocalization and the functional structure of different vibrissae of the ringed seal (Phoca hispida saimensis) of Lake Saimaa, Eastern Finland, were studied. These seals live in darkness under the ice cover for several months during the year. It is known that blind seals are managing well in the lake. Visibility under water in some parts of the area where the seals live is only 2 m. It is suggested that echolocation is used in orientation and feeding. The Saimaa seal has click and click trial underwater vocalizations. However, both the frequency and intensity of the vocalization are low compared with, for example, those of dolphins. The structural adaptations for underwater sound localization are also not well developed. The ringed seal has, however, extremely well-developed vibrissae. The innervation of one vibrissa is more than 10 times greater than normally found in mammals. The main structural deviations from normal mammalian vibrissae are: (1) an upper cavernous sinus, (2) a groove in the wall of the capsule at the level of the lower cavernous sinus, (3) elasticity of the connective tissue bands fixing the hair root to the capsule in the lower cavernous sinus and especially (4) the structure and innervation of the ring sinus area. Sensory elements are situated upon the glassy membrane on the surface of the outer rootsheath and in the basal cell layer of the outer rootsheath which is like a sensory epithelium. Below this epithelium a layer of liquid or gelatinous material and large amounts of glycogen are found. This sensory epithelium is especially well developed in the superciliary vibrissae. These vibrissae are protruded some millimetres when the seals are attentive. It is suggested that the vibrissae also sense sounds, which are transmitted to the sensory elements by tissue conduction through the capsule wall and via the blood sinuses. The seals may possibly detect compressional waves with the vibrissae.},

Recorded types of calls of T. palmeri included chucks, chippering, and chips. Characters of the chip vocalization are reported- Palmer's chipmunk had maximum frequencies that ranged from 10.4 to 12.9 kHz. Minimum frequency at onset ranged from 2.0 to 3.3 kHz, and terminal frequency from 3.8 to 4.3 kHz. Call rate varied from five to 17 calls/5 s of recording time. Females called with significantly higher maximum frequency (12.25 kHz) than males (10.82 kHz). No significant differences were found between sexes for other parameters. Data suggest that differences between male and female calls are not due to size or weight.},

We measured four acoustic parameters of the fundamental frequency of each call: (i) duration; (ii) frequency amplitude; (iii) minimum frequency; and (iv) maximum frequency. We also classified calls by their shape contour by visual inspection of the spectrograms. The obtained values for call duration were 0.046 to 2.08 seconds (mean 0.433, standard deviation (SD) 0.433), amplitude of 0.13 to 2.01 kHz (mean of 0.36, SD 0.29), minimum frequency of 0.22 to 1.80 (mean 0.55, SD 0.29), maximum frequency of 0.46 to 7.50 (mean 1.00, SD 0.89). We classified 73 calls by spectral contour, identifying six basic types of discernible calls, showing heterogeneity among the call types, with C1, C2 and C3 calls presenting higher frequencies, 21, 30 and 23{\%}, respectively. We found that the calls of S. longirostris in the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago are more diverse and complex than previously recognized for spinner dolphins and further studies worldwide can reinforce the broad use of this sound for the species repertoire.},

abstract = {Abstract  The nocturnal orientation behaviour of the late pelagic stages of two reef fish families (Apogonidae and Pomacentridae) was examined using behavioural cages deployed in the field. The behavioural cages enabled the fish to choose between swimming towards or away from the reef in response to natural cues. Overall, 55{\%} of fish displayed a choice in the experiments, however, the proportion varied between the two families, with 67{\%} of pomacentrids and 27{\%} of apogonids displaying a choice. In both families, of the fish which displayed a choice, the proportion of fish swimming towards the reef was significantly greater than 50{\%}, as random movement would predict (64{\%} of pomacentrids and 67{\%} of apogonids swam towards the reef). This proportion did not vary significantly among four field sites with different current regimes and geographic locations. The results suggest that the late pelagic stages of reef fish display nocturnal orientation behaviour, possibly in response to sound, which may aid in their settlement on reefs.},

Reduction in fertility at low population densities has been identified in marine and terrestrial species. Using data on hatch success and hatchling-emergence success as proxies for fertilization success, we conducted a global meta-analysis of data from breeding aggregations of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta). We found that there has been no reduction in fertility in small nesting aggregations in either of these species worldwide. We considered mechanisms within the mating strategies and reproductive biology of marine turtles that may allow for novel genetic input and facilitate enhanced gene flow among rookeries. Behavioral reproductive mechanisms, such as natal philopatry and polyandry, may mitigate potential impacts of depensation and contribute to the resilience of these species.

abstract = {R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}} / Abstract Salmon aquaculture facilities in Downeast Maine are occasionally attacked by harbor seals and gray seals. The predators kill and injure valuable fish and may damage net-pens allowing farm-fish to escape. Industry proponents claim up to 10{\%} of the industry's farmgate value is lost to seal predation. In addition to financial impacts, the escapement of cultured fish may pose a threat to indigenous Atlantic salmon stocks. Salmon growers in Maine employ a variety of predator control measures-netting systems, underwater acoustic devices and pyrotechnics-but no battery of protections seems to be 100{\%} effective. In the past, those seals who could defeat deterrence strategies would be targeted for lethal removal. Recent amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), however now prohibit the killing of depredating seals. This paper provides an overview of the problem, surveys technological and non-technological solutions and mitigating measures, and describes the work of a stakeholder task force convened by the National Marine Fisheries Service to investigate the matter. },

The new dinosaur is the largest dromaeosaurid yet discovered in the Southern Hemisphere and depicts bizarre cranial and postcranial features. Its long and low snout bears numerous, small-sized conical teeth, a condition resembling spinosaurid theropods. Its short forearms depart from the characteristically long-armed condition of all dromaeosaurids and their close avian relatives. The new discovery amplifies the range of morphological disparity among unenlagiines, demonstrating that by the end of the Cretaceous this clade included large, short-armed forms alongside crow-sized, long-armed, possibly flying representatives. The new dinosaur is the youngest record of dromaeosaurids from Gondwana and represents a previously unrecognized lineage of large predators in Late Cretaceous dinosaur faunas mainly dominated by abelisaurid theropods.},

Advantages of acoustic methods over visual ones include the ability to detect submerged animals, to work at night, and to work in any weather conditions. A relatively inexpensive and easy-to-use acoustic float, the QUEphone, was developed by converting a commercially available profiler float to a mobile platform, adding acoustic capability, and installing the ERMA cetacean click detection algorithm of Klinck and Mellinger [(2011). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 129(4), 1807-1812] running on a high-power DSP. The QUEphone was tested at detecting Blainville's beaked whales at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC), a Navy acoustic test range in the Bahamas, in June 2010. Beaked whale were present at AUTEC, and the performance of the QUEphone was compared with the Navy's Marine Mammal Monitoring on Navy Ranges (M3R) system. The field tests provided data useful to evaluate the QUEphone's operational capability as a tool to detect beaked whales and report their presence in near-real time. The range tests demonstrated that the QUEphone's beaked whale detections were comparable to that of M3R's, and that the float is effective at detecting beaked whales.},

abstract = {Seventeen groups of chinchillas with 11 to 16 animals/group (sigmaN = 207) were exposed for 5 days to either a Gaussian (G) noise or 1 of 16 different non-Gaussian (non-G) noises at 100 dB(A) SPL. All exposures had the same total energy and approximately the same flat spectrum but their statistical properties were varied to yield a series of exposure conditions that varied across a continuum from G through various non-G conditions to pure impact noise exposures. The non-G character of the noise was produced by inserting high level transients (impacts or noise bursts) into the otherwise G noise. The peak SPL of the transients, their bandwidth, and the intertransient intervals were varied, as was the rms level of the G noise. The statistical metric, kurtosis (beta), computed on the unfiltered noise beta(t), was varied 3 {\textless} or = beta(t) {\textless} or = 105. Brainstem auditory evoked responses were used to estimate hearing thresholds and surface preparation histology was used to determine sensory cell loss. Trauma, as measured by asymptotic and permanent threshold shifts (ATS, PTS) and by sensory cell loss, was greater for all of the non-G exposure conditions. Permanent effects of the exposures increased as beta(t) increased and reached an asymptote at beta(t) approximately 40. For beta(t) {\textgreater} 40 varying the interval or peak histograms did not alter the level of trauma, suggesting that, in the chinchilla model, for beta(t) {\textgreater} 40 an energy metric may be effective in evaluating the potential of non-G noise environments to produce hearing loss. Reducing the probability of a transient occurring could reduce the permanent effects of the non-G exposures. These results lend support to those standards documents that use an energy metric for gauging the hazard of exposure but only after applying a "correction factor" when high level transients are present. Computing beta on the filtered noise signal [beta(f)] provides a frequency specific metric for the non-G noises that is correlated with the additional frequency specific outer hair cell loss produced by the non-G noise. The data from the abundant and varied exposure conditions show that the kurtosis of the amplitude distribution of a noise environment is an important variable in determining the hazards to hearing posed by non-Gaussian noise environments.},

abstract = {Small cetaceans are incidental bycatch in gillnet fisheries. Dolphin and porpoise bycatch has been reduced by the use of barium sulphate-enhanced gillnets. This decreased entanglement is likely the result of either higher acoustic reflectivity or greater stiffness for barium nets. To address these variables, our study quantified the acoustic reflectivity and stiffness of six net types including barium sulphate, iron oxide-enhanced and control demersal gillnets of sizes which typically target cod (Godus morhua) and monkfish (Lophius americanus). Acoustic reflectivity, or target strength (TS), was assessed using dolphin and porpoise-like sonar signals from 0 degrees to 40 degrees. TS values were used to calculate likely detection ranges. Barium sulphate- and iron oxide-enhanced nets showed increased reflectivity compared with control nets, with the barium sulphate nets generating the highest TS values. Dolphins should detect these nets in time to avoid contact, but porpoises, with typically lower source levels, may not detect nets at a range great enough to avoid entanglement. Barium sulphate line was significantly stiffer than comparable nylon line. All lines lost stiffness when soaked in seawater for 24 h. Barium sulphate nets proved stiffer and more acoustically reflective, and both factors are likely important in reducing harbour porpoise bycatch.},

abstract = {Abstract  Killer whale discrete calls include types containing an overlapping high-frequency component (biphonic calls) and types without an overlapping high-frequency component (monophonic calls). In the resident killer whales of the Northeast Pacific, biphonic discrete calls exhibit higher source levels than monophonic calls, which suggests different active space and consequently different functions for monophonic and biphonic call types. In this study we investigate the potential communicative functions of monophonic and biphonic discrete calls produced by killer whales from Kamchatka (Northwest Pacific). We analyze how the usage of these calls depends on the number of pods present in the area and type of activity. Our results show that the usage of monophonic and biphonic calls in Kamchatkan killer whales depends on the number of pods in the area and is less dependent on the type of activity. Biphonic calls are more common when more than one pod is present in the area and could therefore function as markers of pod and matriline affiliation, serving mainly as cohesion signals. Monophonic calls dominated the vocalizations when a single pod was present, while in the presence of more than one pod both categories were used in equal proportions.},

A difficult, yet crucial task is to identify food web structures, or food web motifs, that are the building blocks of this baroque network of interactions. Once identified, these food web motifs can then be examined through experiments and theory to provide mechanistic explanations for how structure governs ecosystem stability. Here, we synthesize recent ecological research to show that generalist consumers coupling resources with different interaction strengths, is one such motif. This motif amazingly occurs across an enormous range of spatial scales, and so acts to distribute coupled weak and strong interactions throughout food webs. We then perform an experiment that illustrates the importance of this motif to ecological stability. We find that weak interactions coupled to strong interactions by generalist consumers dampen strong interaction strengths and increase community stability. This study takes a critical step by isolating a common food web motif and through clear, experimental manipulation, identifies the fundamental stabilizing consequences of this structure for ecological communities.},

Using ABR we found that auditory evoked potentials can be obtained in the frequency range 400 to 1500 Hz (Sepiotheutis lessoniana) and 400 to 1000 Hz (Octopus vulgaris), respectively.

abstract = {Abstract  Acoustic recordings were made in the presence of four single-species schools of Fraser's Dolphin Lagenodelphis hosei during combined acoustic and visual shipboard line-transect cetacean abundance surveys. Recordings were made using a towed hydrophone array and sonobuoys. Echolocation clicks were detected during only one recording session and no burst pulses were detected. Whistles were present in all four recording sessions. Fourteen variables were measured from the fundamental frequencies of 60 whistles. The whistles were generally simple, with few inflection points or steps. Whistles ranged from 6.6 kHz to 23.5 kHz, with durations ranging from 0.06 to 0.93 sec. Whistle characteristics closely match those reported for L. hosei recorded in the Gulf of Mexico (Leatherwood et al. 1993) and the Caribbean (Watkins et al. 1994), although, in general, the Pacific dolphins were less vocally active than the Caribbean dolphins described by Watkins et al. (1994). This difference may be related to the orientation of the hydrophone array relative to the dolphins. It may also be due to behaviour, as the Caribbean dolphins were engaged in feeding activities and the Pacific dolphins were fast travelling to evade the approaching vessel.

abstract = {This study demonstrated the ability of a false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) to discriminate between two targets and investigated the parameters of the whale's emitted signals for changes related to test conditions. Target detection performance comparable to the bottlenose dolphin's (Tursiops truncatus) has previously been reported for echolocating false killer whales. No other echolocation capabilities have been reported. A false killer whale, naive to conditioned echolocation tasks, was initially trained to detect a cylinder in a "go/no-go" procedure over ranges of 3 to 8 m. The transition from a detection task to a discrimination task was readily achieved by introducing a spherical comparison target. Finally, the cylinder was successfully compared to spheres of two different sizes and target strengths. Multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the parameters of emitted signals. Duncan's multiple range tests showed significant decreases (df = 185, p {\textless} 0.05) in both source level and bandwidth in the transition from detection to discrimination. Analysis of variance revealed a significant decrease in the number of clicks over test conditions [F(5,26) = 5.23, p {\textless} 0.0001]. These data suggest that the whale relied on cues relevant to target shape as well as target strength, that changes in source level and bandwidth were task-related, that the decrease in clicks was associated with learning experience, and that Pseudorca's ability to discriminate shapes using echolocation may be comparable to that of Tursiops truncatus.},

abstract = {Toothed whales (Odontoceti, Cetacea) navigate and locate prey by means of active echolocation. Studies on captive animals have accumulated a large body of knowledge concerning the production, reception and processing of sound in odontocete biosonars, but there is little information about the properties and use of biosonar clicks of free-ranging animals in offshore habitats. This study presents the first source parameter estimates of biosonar clicks from two free-ranging oceanic delphinids, the opportunistically foraging Pseudorca crassidens and the cephalopod eating Grampus griseus. Pseudorca produces short duration (30 mus), broadband (Q = 2-3) signals with peak frequencies around 40 kHz, centroid frequencies of 30-70 kHz, and source levels between 201-225 dB re. 1 muPa (peak to peak, pp). Grampus also produces short (40 mus), broadband (Q = 2-3) signals with peak frequencies around 50 kHz, centroid frequencies of 60-90 kHz, and source levels between 202 and 222 dB re. 1 muPa (pp). On-axis clicks from both species had centroid frequencies in the frequency range of most sensitive hearing, and lower peak frequencies and higher source levels than reported from captive animals. It is demonstrated that sound production in these two free-ranging echolocators is dynamic, and that free-ranging animals may not always employ biosonar signals comparable to the extreme signal properties reported from captive animals in long-range detection tasks. Similarities in source parameters suggest that evolutionary factors other than prey type determine the properties of biosonar signals of the two species. Modelling shows that interspecific detection ranges of prey types differ from 80 to 300 m for Grampus and Pseudorca, respectively.},

abstract = {Duetting, found in many animal taxa, is still a poorly understood form of signalling behaviour despite numerous hypotheses to explain its function. One contentious issue is whether duetting is a cooperative endeavour or signals conflict between the sexes. We studied the function of duetting in the tropical boubou, using interactive playback experiments. We staged encounters by presenting paired birds with four variants of each of four duet types (neighbour and stranger solos and neighbour and stranger duets). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that both joint territorial defence and mutual mate guarding are important functions of duetting, and that both cooperation and conflict between males and females have shaped duetting behaviour. Of a repertoire of 12 duet types, eight were used for joint territorial defence. Two of these eight duet types were probably also used for mutual mate guarding, suggesting that individual duets can have multiple functions. We found an unusual response for duetting birds in that females often synchronized notes with male solo playback to form precise duets. In turn, males attempted to jam the song of rivals when females joined the song of male solo playback, providing further evidence for the importance of acoustic mate guarding. Song jamming by males has not previously been described for duetting species. Finally, we suggest that the repertoire of duet types is used to fine-tune territorial encounters in a network environment of multiple interactants.},

abstract = {The current system of publication in biomedical research provides a distorted view of the reality of scientific data that are generated in the laboratory and clinic. This system can be studied by applying principles from the field of economics. The “winner's curse,” a more general statement of publication bias, suggests that the small proportion of results chosen for publication are unrepresentative of scientists' repeated samplings of the real world. The self-correcting mechanism in science is retarded by the extreme imbalance between the abundance of supply (the output of basic science laboratories and clinical investigations) and the increasingly limited venues for publication (journals with sufficiently high impact). This system would be expected intrinsically to lead to the misallocation of resources. The scarcity of available outlets is artificial, based on the costs of printing in an electronic age and a belief that selectivity is equivalent to quality. Science is subject to great uncertainty: we cannot be confident now which efforts will ultimately yield worthwhile achievements. However, the current system abdicates to a small number of intermediates an authoritative prescience to anticipate a highly unpredictable future. In considering society's expectations and our own goals as scientists, we believe that there is a moral imperative to reconsider how scientific data are judged and disseminated.},

abstract = {Humans and non-human mammals exhibit fundamentally similar vocal responses to increased noise, including increases in vocalization amplitude (the Lombard effect) and changes to spectral and temporal properties of vocalizations. Different research focuses have resulted in significant discrepancies in study methodologies and hypotheses among fields, leading to particular knowledge gaps and techniques specific to each field. This review compares and contrasts noise-induced vocal modifications observed from human and non-human mammals with reference to experimental design and the history of each field. Topics include the effects of communication motivation and subject-specific characteristics on the acoustic parameters of vocalizations, examination of evidence for a proposed biomechanical linkage between the Lombard effect and other spectral and temporal modifications, and effects of noise on self-communication signals (echolocation). Standardized terminology, cross-taxa tests of hypotheses, and open areas for future research in each field are recommended. Findings indicate that more research is needed to evaluate linkages among vocal modifications, context dependencies, and the finer details of the Lombard effect during natural communication. Studies of non-human mammals could benefit from applying the tightly controlled experimental designs developed in human research, while studies of human speech in noise should be expanded to include natural communicative contexts. The effects of experimental design and behavioural context on vocalizations should not be neglected as they may impact the magnitude and type of noise-induced vocal modifications.},

abstract = {The harbor porpoise is one of the smallest and most widely spread of all toothed whales. They are found abundantly in coastal waters all around the northern hemisphere. They are among the 11 species known to use high frequency sonar of relative narrow bandwidth. Their narrow biosonar beam helps isolate echoes from prey among those from unwanted items and noise. Obtaining echoes from small objects like net mesh, net floats, and small prey is facilitated by the very high peak frequency around 130 kHz with a wavelength of about 12 mm. We argue that such echolocation signals and narrow band auditory filters give the harbor porpoise a selective advantage in a coastal environment. Predation by killer whales and a minimum noise region in the ocean around 130 kHz may have provided selection pressures for using narrow bandwidth high frequency biosonar signals.},

The acoustic signals were amplified and sampled to a hard disk at a rate of 800 kHz per channel. The 3 and 10 dB beamwidths were calculated to be 8degrees and 10degrees, respectively, indicating a narrower transmission beam for white-beaked dolphins than that reported for bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). The beamwidth was more similar to that found for belugas (Delphinapterus lucas). The measured beam pattern included large side lobes, perhaps due to the inclusion of off-axis clicks, even after applying several criteria to select only on-axis clicks. The directivity index was calculated to be 18 dB when using all data for angles from 0degrees-50degrees. The calculated sound radiation from a circular piston with a radius of 6 cm driven by a white-beaked dolphin click had a beam pattern very similar to the measured beam pattern for the main transmission lobe of the white-beaked dolphin. The directivity index was 29 dB. This is the first attempt to estimate the directionality index of dolphins in the field.

abstract = {Abstract   Mormyrid fishes use acoustic signals for long-distance communication and a weakly electric field for short-distance interaction. Mormyrids are unique in having an otic gasbladder attached directly to the saccule on each side of the inner ear. Karl von Frisch (1938) hypothesized that the tightly coupled otic gasbladder might aid mormyrid hearing. Using the mormyrid fish (Brienomyrus brachyistius), this study manipulated gas in the otic gasbladder to test this hypothesis and histological sections were made to examine the anatomical relationship between the gasbladder and inner ear. The hearing sensitivity curves (audiograms) were obtained with the auditory brainstem response protocol. Audiograms were obtained from normal fish and from fish in which gas was withdrawn from either one or two otic gasbladders. Removal of gas from one otic gasbladder did not result in a significant change in either hearing ability or acoustically evoked brainwaves as compared to the control fish. Bilateral deflation of the otic gasbladders led to significant threshold changes. Histological sections revealed a particularly close coupling between the otic gasbladder and the saccule chamber. These results support von Frisch's hypothesis that the otic gasbladders of mormyrids assist in underwater sound detection.},

abstract = {Supervised dive classification is a commonly used technique for categorising time-depth Profiles of diving vertebrates. Such analyses permit the description and quantification of dive behaviour and foraging tactics, and highlight feeding locations. Ideally, classification functions should be validated, and this is commonly done visually. Visual classification is subjective, but it is currently one of the few measures available for validation. We develop several approaches to validate a supervised dive classification: (1) two people visually assigning dives and developing a dataset where both agree, and (2) use of dives from southern elephant seals identified as "drift dives" with characteristic velocity signatures. We classified the dives of three seals from their post-moult foraging trips and estimated the error associated with visual classification. We found classification error (disagreement) between classifiers up to 57{\%}. We created a training dataset based on dives with agreement and applied this to a relatively new, automated classification method - the random forests (RF) algorithm. A supervised function developed using this algorithm estimated a classification error of 5{\%} on elephant seal dives; classification error on underrepresented dive classes ranged from 2 - 12{\%}. Testing this classification function on independent data produced a low error (1.6{\%}). RF function errors were lower than for visual classification, and errors were similar to or better than those estimated using discriminant functions. Swim velocity parameters were the most important predictors, but their absence did not reduce the random forests function's effectiveness by much. Our results suggest that there is a temporal shift in diving behaviour as seals become more buoyant. We compared the temporal patterns in drift rate from the drift dives classified using the RF function with the drift dives validated via characteristic velocity signatures. This indicated that the classifications produced by RF function are valid even though some error persists, and we suggest adoption of this method for classifying dives in other air-breathing diving vertebrates.

abstract = {We present a general framework for modelling adaptive trait dynamics in which we integrate various concepts and techniques from modern ESS-theory. The concept of evolutionarily singular strategies is introduced as a generalization of the ESS-concept. We give a full classification of the singular strategies in terms of ESS-stability, convergence stability, the ability of the singular strategy to invade other populations if initially rare itself, and the possibility of protected dimorphisms occurring within the singular strategy's neighbourhood. Of particular interest is a type of singular strategy that is an evolutionary attractor from a great distance, but once in its neighbourhood a population becomes dimorphic and undergoes disruptive selection leading to evolutionary branching. Modelling the adaptive growth and branching of the evolutionary tree can thus be considered as a major application of the framework. A haploid version of Levene's ‘soft selection' model is developed as a specific example to demonstrate evolutionary dynamics and branching in monomorphic and polymorphic populations.},

abstract = {Directional asymmetry (DA) of the lengths, diameters, and masses of the scapula, humerus, radius, and ulna were analyzed on a sample of 213 harbor porpoises from Denmark and West Greenland. The levels of DA were consistent across yearlings and older animals, mature and immature animals, sexes, and populations. All investigated variables showed significant DA favoring the right side. For the pooled sample, DA of lengths ranged from 0.2{\%} SE 0.1 (ulna) to 1.2{\%} SE 0.1 (scapula). DAs of diameters were 1.5{\%} SE 0.2 for the humerus, 0.6{\%} SE 0.1 for the radius, and 1.3{\%} SE 0.2 for the ulna. DA of mass ranged from 2.8{\%} SE 0.5 (humerus) to 4.3{\%} SE 0.7 (ulna). The humerus and ulna had significantly larger mean diameter/ length ratios on the right side than the left, making them more robust. The large DA of scapula length indicates larger muscle mass associated with the right flipper, while the generally more robust right humerii and ulnae may be designed for higher levels of mechanical stress. These DAs and the examples of lateralized behavior recorded in cetaceans, point to the existence of lateralized use of the flippers at the population level in harbor porpoises and possibly other cetacean species.},

Using the transmission line modelling (TLM) technique and published computed tomography (CT) data of an atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), a series of sound propagation experiments have been carried out. It is shown that the teeth in the lower jaw can be viewed as a periodic array of scattering elements which result in the formation of an acoustic stop band (or band gap) that is angular dependent. It is shown through simple and complex geometry simulations that performance enhancements such as improved gain and isolation between the two receive paths can be achieved. This mechanism has the potential to be exploited in direction-finding sonar.},

abstract = {Echolocating bats emit sonar pulses and listen to returning echoes to probe their surroundings. Bats adapt their echolocation call design to cope with dynamic changes in the acoustic environment, including habitat change or the presence of nearby conspecifics/heterospecifics. Seven pairs of big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, were tested in this study to examine how they adjusted their echolocation calls when flying and competing with a conspecific for food. Results showed that differences in five call parameters, start/end frequencies, duration, bandwidth and sweep rate, significantly increased in the two-bat condition compared with the baseline data. In addition, the magnitude of spectral separation of calls was negatively correlated with the baseline call design differences in individual bats. Bats with small baseline call frequency differences showed larger increases in call frequency separation when paired than those with large baseline call frequency differences, suggesting that bats actively change their sonar call structure if pre-existing differences in call design are small. Call design adjustments were also influenced by physical spacing between two bats. Calls of paired bats exhibited the largest design separations when inter-bat distance was shorter than 0.5 m, and the separation decreased as the spacing increased. All individuals modified at least one baseline call parameter in response to the presence of another conspecific. We propose that dissimilarity between the time-frequency features of sonar calls produced by different bats aids each individual in segregating echoes of its own sonar vocalizations from the acoustic signals of neighboring bats.},

The three herds shared 17 call types. The Jan Mayen herd had one call type not found in the Gulf or Front. One of the Gulf and Front call types was not found at Jan Mayen. Based on ANOVA post hoc pairwise comparisons between locations, the three herds exhibited a similar number of within-call type differences in duration, number of elements, start pitch and end pitch. There were no differences in proportional usage of call types between the Gulf and Front herds but both differed in a similar manner from those of the Jan Mayen herd. These findings support tagging studies that indicate that the Gulf and Front herds may be interbreeding and both are reproductively isolated from the Jan Mayen herd. We found no evidence of acoustic adaptation to the site-specific ice and environmental conditions associated with the three study locations.},

abstract = {For wild, sea-run brown trout (Salmo trutta) smolts, the physiological consequences of abrupt transfer to seawater and simultaneous challenge with copepodid larvae of the sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer, 1837), were investigated in the laboratory. Analysis of osmoregulatory, metabolic, and stress markers allowed the derivation of a sublethal threshold burden of L. salmonis, above which the host suffers major physiological stress. Noticeable lice effects, consistent across all measured markers, were not observed until L. salmonis developed to the mobile preadult and adult stages. Preadult L. salmonis caused significant increases in plasma chloride, osmolality, glucose, lactate, and cortisol and a significant reduction in haematocrit. Piecewise linear statistical approaches allowed the determination of abrupt changes in these physiological markers, attributable to the intensity of L. salmonis infestation on individual fish, and identification of overall threshold lice burdens. Thirteen mobile lice center dot fish(-1) (weight range 19-70 g) was a consistent breakpoint across several physiological measures. This information will provide a valuable, objectively derived tool to aid in the formulation of effective wild fisheries management policy concerning S. trutta conservation.},

A. forsteri was decimated by sealers prior to the early 1900s and although numbers have increased over the past 50 years, it remains one of the least known pinnipeds. Behavior was studied in a breeding and in a nonbreeding colony. Numbers in the breeding colony did not show marked seasonal change but there were changes in proportions of the sexes and various age classes present. The annual cycle is described insofar as it is known at present. Much of the agonistic behavior of A. forsteri is ritualized and six associated postures and three calls are described. The full neck display is one of the most important postures and appears to function as a threat by which males are able to assess another's status without fighting. No data on behavior at the peak reproductive period, mid-November to late December, are available. The behavioral sequence by which a female locates her pup appears stereotyped. Vocalization and sight are important initially and olfactory recognition of the pup by the female gives final confirmation. Observations on locomotion, reactions to temperature, and reaction to humans are included.},

abstract = {Abstract A questionnaire survey was sent to managers of marine salmon farm sites in Scotland to update knowledge on problems from predators and the use of antipredator controls. Of the 195 respondents, 5 had no antipredator controls with the remaining 190 having some level of control. Throughout Scotland, managers reported 12 species of predator. Seals were reported to be predators at 81{\%} of sites. In total, 19 different types of antipredator control were used. Top nets were employed most widely, being used by 88{\%} of the 195 respondents followed by seal scarers (52{\%}) and shooting (49{\%}). Shooting was considered to be very effective by 45 (62{\%}) of the 73 site managers who expressed an opinion on its effectiveness. Views on the effectiveness of seal scarers varied markedly among site managers, and only 21 (23{\%}) of 92 managers considered them to be very effective. There was also considerable variation in the perceived effectiveness of different types of antipredator nets. Comparison with previous studies showed that although there was a significant increase in the proportion of farms at which seals were reported to have caused loss or damage between 1985 and 1987, there has been no further increase. There were no significant changes over time in reported problems from other species of predator. The proportions of farms using nets and shooting to deter predators are remarkably consistent between the study periods. However, the use of seal scarers has increased significantly from 10{\%} in 1985 to 52{\%} in 2001. The survey suggests that the degrees of protection afforded by predator control methods vary appreciably between sites. There is a need for a range of antipredator devices to be tested under controlled conditions to determine under which circumstances each is most effective. This is particularly the case regarding seal scarers.},

abstract = {In 2006, we used the U.S. Coast Guard's Automatic Identification System (AIS) to describe patterns of large commercial ship traffic within a U.S. National Marine Sanctuary located off the coast of Massachusetts. We found that 541 large commercial vessels transited the greater sanctuary 3413 times during the year. Cargo ships, tankers, and tug/tows constituted 78{\%} of the vessels and 82{\%} of the total transits. Cargo ships, tankers, and cruise ships predominantly used the designated Boston Traffic Separation Scheme, while tug/tow traffic was concentrated in the western and northern portions of the sanctuary. We combined AIS data with low-frequency acoustic data from an array of nine autonomous recording units analyzed for 2 months in 2006. Analysis of received sound levels (10-1000 Hz, root-mean-square pressure re 1 microPa +/- SE) averaged 119.5 +/- 0.3 dB at high-traffic locations. High-traffic locations experienced double the acoustic power of less trafficked locations for the majority of the time period analyzed. Average source level estimates (71-141 Hz, root-mean-square pressure re 1 microPa +/- SE) for individual vessels ranged from 158 +/- 2 dB (research vessel) to 186 +/- 2 dB (oil tanker). Tankers were estimated to contribute 2 times more acoustic power to the region than cargo ships, and more than 100 times more than research vessels. Our results indicate that noise produced by large commercial vessels was at levels and within frequencies that warrant concern among managers regarding the ability of endangered whales to maintain acoustic contact within greater sanctuary waters.},

abstract = {Nine bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) calves that stranded in Virginia in 1996 and 1997 died of severe blunt-force trauma. Injuries were concentrated on the head and chest and multiple rib fractures, lung lacerations, and soft tissue contusions were prominent. Skeletal and/or soft tissue trauma occurred bilaterally in all of the calves. One had a bite wound across the left mandible that exhibited deep punctures consistent with the tooth placement in an adult bottlenose dolphin. The lesions were not compatible with predation, boat strike, fisheries interactions, rough-surf injury, or blast injury. However, they were similar to traumatic injuries described in stranded bottlenose dolphin calves and harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) in Great Britain attributed to violent dolphin interactions. The evidence suggests that violent dolphin behavior was the cause of the trauma in the nine calves reported here and that infanticide occurs in bottlenose dolphins of the western North Atlantic.},

abstract = {A relational database that contained published information on the diving behavior and/or movement patterns of marine mammals was compiled to facilitate a modeling effort of the Effects of Sound on the Marine Environment (ESME) program. A total of 448 references from reports, books, and peer-reviewed journal articles were obtained. The metadata describing each animal studied, location of the study, and equipment used were entered into the database as well as empirical data describing the diving behavior and movement patterns of each animal. In total, the database contained 1815 entries from 51 different marine mammal species or subspecies. The majority of animals were seals and sea lions with 1560 entries from 29 individual species. More than half the number of animals studied were from high latitude regions (e.g., Arctic and Antarctic). Other problem areas identified were: 1) Data reduction in summaries, 2) inability to easily summarize qualitative and quantitative data, and 3) lack of standardization in data reporting. A solution is to create a common access data archive where researchers contribute raw published or unpublished geospatially referenced data sets. This would improve access to original data sets with large volumes of data, which, overall, enhances the power to develop robust behavioral or ecological models that could help define critical habitats of marine mammals},

abstract = {A review of our whale observations of more than 25 years indicated that each of the species commonly observed within 35 km of Cape Cod reacted differently to stimuli from human activities, and that these responses have gradually changed with time. Over the years of exposure to ships, for example, minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) have changed from frequent positive interest to generally uninterested reactions, finback whales (B. physalus) have changed from mostly negative to uninterested reactions, right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) have apparently continued the same variety of responses with little change, and humpbacks (Megaptera novaeangliae) have dramatically changed from mixed responses that were often negative to often strongly positive reactions. These reactions appeared to result mostly from three types of stimuli: primarily underwater sound, then light reflectivity, and tactile sensation. The whale reactions were related to their assessment of the stimuli as attractive, uninteresting or disturbing, their assessment of the movements of the sources of the stimuli relative to their own positions, and their assessment of the occurrence of stimuli as expected or unexpected. Whale reactions were modified by their previous experience and current activity: habituation often occurred rapidly, attention to other stimuli or preoccupation with other activities sometimes overcame their interest or wariness of stimuli, and inactivity seemed to allow whales to notice and react to stimuli that otherwise might have been ignored. The changes over time in the reactions of whales to stimuli from human activities were gradual and constantly varying with increased exposure to these activities.},

From 1981 through 2002 an extensive research was performed to collect information about stranding of manatees on the northeast coast of Brazil. Data were separated in two distinct periods (1981-1990 and 1991-2002) and analyzed according to specific categories: stranded dead (captured by nets, captured by harpoons and undefined cause) and stranded alive (dead in captivity and captive population). There were 74 events of stranding manatees in the period surveyed. Thirty-one events of dead manatees and 43 events of specimens that survived until December 2002 were recorded. In the last years of the study there were more strandings of alive animals than dead. The main reason for the strandings of manatee calves in northeastern Brazil is the separation from their mothers. The largest numbers of stranded manatees occurred in Cear{\'{a}} and Rio Grande do Norte states.},

abstract = {Deceptive mimicry is one of several hypotheses for the evolution of song copying in oscine songbirds. This hypothesis predicts that a floater or immigrant male that sings local song types may be perceived as a territory owner and benefit from the reduced aggression commonly observed between established neighbours ([`]dear enemy' effect). The present study employed a field playback experiment to test the short-term ability of mimics to deceive territorial male song sparrows,Melospiza melodia . A set of three nonshared song type stimuli was presented to individual focal birds from the territory boundary of an adjacent male: a song type recorded from this adjacent neighbour (Neighbour), and two from non-neighbouring males that were an unfamiliar song type (Stranger) and a song type in the neighbour's repertoire (Mimic). The behavioural response to the Mimic was often as strong as, and sometimes stronger than, the response to the Stranger and was significantly more aggressive than to the Neighbour. Thus most birds accurately assessed the Mimic as a non-neighbouring invader. This study also revealed a significant negative correlation between the number of songs a subject shared with his neighbour and his aggressive response to the Neighbour stimulus. Song sharing is associated with reduced aggression between neighbours, but the mechanism is not deceptive mimicry. In this species with age-restricted learning, song sharing may serve as an indicator of a bird's competitive strength and ability to establish and maintain a territory near his adult song tutors.},

abstract = {Individual animals and humans show differing susceptibility to noise damage even under very carefully controlled exposure conditions. This difference in susceptibility may be related to unknown genetic components. Common experimental animals (rats, guinea pigs, chinchillas, cats) are outbred-their genomes contain an admixture of many genes. Many mouse strains have been inbred over many generations reducing individual variability, making them ideal candidates for studying the genetic modulation of individual susceptibility. Erway et al. (1993) demonstrated a recessive gene associated with early presbycusis in the C57BL/6J inbred mouse. A series of studies have shown that mice homozygous for Ahl allele are more sensitive to the damaging effects of noise. Recent work has shown that mice homozygous for Ahl are not only more sensitive to noise, but also are probably damaged in a different manner by noise than mice containing the wild-type gene (Davis et al., 2001). Recent work in Noben-Trauth's lab (Di Palma et al., 2001) has shown that the wild-type Ahl gene codes for a hair cell specific cadherin. Cadherins are calcium dependent proteins that hold cells together at adherins junctions to form tissues and organs. The cadherin of interest named otocadherin or CDH23, is localized to the stereocillia of the outer hair cells. Our working hypothesis, suggests that otocadherin may form the lateral links between stereocilia described by Pickles et al (1989). Reduction of, or missing otocadherin weakens the cell and may allow stereocilia to be more easily physically damaged by loud sounds and by aging.},

abstract = {Echolocation signals were recorded from big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, flying in the field and the laboratory. In open field areas the interpulse intervals (IPI) of search signals were either around 134 ms or twice that value, 270 ms. At long IPI's the signals were of long duration (14 to 18-20 ms), narrow bandwidth, and low frequency, sweeping down to a minimum frequency (F-min,) of 22-25 kHz. At short IPI's the signals were shorter (6-13 ms), of higher frequency, and broader bandwidth. Tn wooded areas only short (6-11 ms) relatively broadband search signals were emitted at a higher rate (avg. IPI = 122 ms) with higher F-min (27-30 kHz). In the laboratory the IPI was even shorter (88 ms), the duration was 3-5 ms, and the F-min 30-35 kHz, resembling approach phase signals of field recordings. Excluding terminal phase signals, all signals from all areas showed a negative correlation between signal duration and F-min,, i.e., the shorter the signal, the higher was F-min. This correlation was reversed in the terminal phase of insect capture sequences, where F-min, decreased with decreasing signal duration. Overall, the signals recorded in the field were longer, with longer IPI's and greater variability in bandwidth than signals recorded in the laboratory. (C) 2000 Acoustical Society of America.

We present results from full coverage optical imaging surveys conducted in the field by our AUV to illustrate the impact of these refinements on the ability of the vehicle to successfully complete its missions and the quality of the resulting seafloor models.},

Significant interactions of marine mammals and sea turtles with commercial fishing gear have been documented for many years. Statutes and regulations governing commercial fishery/protected species interactions provide for conservation and recovery of protected marine species. Some species of marine mammals, sea turtles, and fish are listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and all marine mammals are managed under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. Both these statues have provisions linking them to commercial fisheries and provide varied strategies for reaching conservation goals. Interactions of protected species with commercial fishing gear range from direct entanglement, capture, and disruption of normal behaviors, to adverse modification of critical habitats. For the foreseeable future of New England fisheries, it is likely that wherever protected species and fishing activity co-occur, interactions will continue. Management trends include increased stakeholder involvement, close coordination with fishery management, and emphasis on technological solutions to interaction problems.},

abstract = {Toothed whales rely on sound to echolocate prey and communicate with conspecifics, but little is known about how extreme pressure affects pneumatic sound production in deep-diving species with a limited air supply. The short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) is a highly social species among the deep-diving toothed whales, in which individuals socialize at the surface but leave their social group in pursuit of prey at depths of up to 1000 m. To investigate if these animals communicate acoustically at depth and test whether hydrostatic pressure affects communication signals, acoustic DTAGs logging sound, depth and orientation were attached to 12 pilot whales. Tagged whales produced tonal calls during deep foraging dives at depths of up to 800 m. Mean call output and duration decreased with depth despite the increased distance to conspecifics at the surface. This shows that the energy content of calls is lower at depths where lungs are collapsed and where the air volume available for sound generation is limited by ambient pressure. Frequency content was unaffected, providing a possible cue for group or species identification of diving whales. Social calls may be important to maintain social ties for foraging animals, but may be impacted adversely by vessel noise.},

abstract = {1. Saccular microphonic potentials in cod (Gadus morhua) were recorded by means of implanted electrodes during sound stimulation with different swimbladder volumes. To obtain acceptable acoustic conditions, the experiments were conducted at 6 m depth in the sea.2. Swimbladder volume had no effect on the microphonic potentials at 100 Hz, whereas its effect was marked at higher frequencies. The sound pressure necessary to evoke microphonic potentials just above the electric background noise was about 20 dB higher for the empty bladder, compared to the full bladder at 300 Hz.3. The microphonic potentials are ultimately linked to excitation of eighth-nerve fibres, and it is concluded that the existence of gas in the cod swimbladder has a positive effect on hearing sensitivity for all frequencies from a lower transient frequency to the upper frequency limit of hearing. Gas in the swimbladder will furthermore extend the audible frequency range.4. The upper frequency limit for the saccular microphonic potentials is in good agreement with the upper audible frequency limit determined from behavioural audiograms for cod, thus indicating that this frequency cut-off may be due to inadequacy of the peripheral auditory apparatus.},

abstract = {Acoustic exposure and behavior of 8 sperm whales were recorded with acoustic and movement-recording tags before, during and after 5 separate 1-2 h controlled sound exposures of industry-provided airgun arrays. None of the 8 whales changed behavioral state (7 foraging, 1 resting) following the start of ramp-up at distances of 7-13 km, or full array exposures at 1-13 km. The most closely approached whale rested throughout exposure but started a foraging dive shortly after the airguns ceased, possibly indicating a delay in foraging during exposure. Using visual tracking and dead-reckoning of tagged animals, we found that their direction-of-movement was random with respect to the airguns, but correlated with their direction-of-movement just prior to the start of exposure, indicating that the tested whales did not show horizontal avoidance of the airguns. Oscillations in pitch generated by swimming movements during foraging dives were on average 6{\%} lower during exposure than during the immediately following post-exposure period, with all 7 foraging whales exhibiting less pitching (p=0.014). Buzz rates, a proxy for attempts to capture prey, were 19{\%} lower during exposure but given natural variation in buzz rates and the small numbers of whales, this effect was not statistically significant (P=0.141). Though additional studies are strongly recommended, these initial results indicate that sperm whales in the highly exposed Gulf of Mexico habitat do not exhibit avoidance reactions to airguns, but suggest they are affected at ranges well beyond those currently regulated due to more subtle effects on their foraging behavior.},

abstract = {BackgroundThe utility of healthcare utilization data from US emergency departments (EDs) for rapid monitoring of changes in influenza-like illness (ILI) activity was highlighted during the recent influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. Monitoring has tended to rely on detection algorithms, such as the Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS), which are limited in their ability to detect subtle changes and identify disease trends.ObjectiveTo evaluate a complementary approach, change point analysis (CPA), for detecting changes in the incidence of ED visits due to ILI.Methodology and principal findingsData collected through the Distribute project (isdsdistribute.org), which aggregates data on ED visits for ILI from over 50 syndromic surveillance systems operated by state or local public health departments were used. The performance was compared of the cumulative sum (CUSUM) CPA method in combination with EARS and the performance of three CPA methods (CUSUM, structural change model and Bayesian) in detecting change points in daily time-series data from four contiguous US states participating in the Distribute network. Simulation data were generated to assess the impact of autocorrelation inherent in these time-series data on CPA performance. The CUSUM CPA method was robust in detecting change points with respect to autocorrelation in time-series data (coverage rates at 90{\%} when -0.2≤$\rho$≤0.2 and 80{\%} when -0.5≤$\rho$≤0.5). During the 2008-9 season, 21 change points were detected and ILI trends increased significantly after 12 of these change points and decreased nine times. In the 2009-10 flu season, we detected 11 change points and ILI trends increased significantly after two of these change points and decreased nine times. Using CPA combined with EARS to analyze automatically daily ED-based ILI data, a significant increase was detected of 3{\%} in ILI on April 27, 2009, followed by multiple anomalies in the ensuing days, suggesting the onset of the H1N1 pandemic in the four contiguous states.Conclusions and significanceAs a complementary approach to EARS and other aberration detection methods, the CPA method can be used as a tool to detect subtle changes in time-series data more effectively and determine the moving direction (ie, up, down, or stable) in ILI trends between change points. The combined use of EARS and CPA might greatly improve the accuracy of outbreak detection in syndromic surveillance systems.},

abstract = {The evolution of speech can be studied independently of the evolution of language, with the advantage that most aspects of speech acoustics, physiology and neural control are shared with animals, and thus open to empirical investigation. At least two changes were necessary prerequisites for modern human speech abilities: (1) modification of vocal tract morphology, and (2) development of vocal imitative ability. Despite an extensive literature, attempts to pinpoint the timing of these changes using fossil data have proven inconclusive. However, recent comparative data from nonhuman primates have shed light on the ancestral use of formants (a crucial cue in human speech) to identify individuals and gauge body size. Second, comparative analysis of the diverse vertebrates that have evolved vocal imitation (humans, cetaceans, seals and birds) provides several distinct, testable hypotheses about the adaptive function of vocal mimicry. These developments suggest that, for understanding the evolution of speech, comparative analysis of living species provides a viable alternative to fossil data. However, the neural basis for vocal mimicry and for mimesis in general remains unknown.},

abstract = {Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) use broadband, ultrasonic echolocation signals with a -10 dB bandwidth from 26 to 51 kHz to search for, localize, and approach prey that generally consist of mid-water and deep-water fishes and squid. Although it is well known that the spectral characteristics of broadband echoes from marine organisms vary as a function of size, shape, orientation, and anatomical group, there is little evidence as to whether or not free-ranging toothed whales use spectral cues in discriminating between prey and nonprey. In order to study the prey-classification process, a stereo acoustic tag was deployed on a Blainville's beaked whale so that emitted clicks and the corresponding echoes from targets in the water could be recorded. A comparison of echoes from targets apparently selected by the whale and those from a sample of scatterers that were not selected suggests that spectral features of the echoes, target strengths, or both may have been used by the whale to discriminate between echoes. Specifically, the whale appears to favor targets with one or more nulls in the echo spectra and to seek prey with higher target strengths at deeper depths. (C) 2008 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {A behavioral response paradigm was used to measure masked underwater hearing thresholds in five bottlenose dolphins and two white whales before and immediately after exposure to intense 1-s tones at 0.4, 3, 10, 20, and 75 kHz. The resulting levels of fatiguing stimuli necessary to induce 6 dB or larger masked temporary threshold shifts (MTTSs) were generally between 192 and 201 dB re: 1 microPa. The exceptions occurred at 75 kHz, where one dolphin exhibited an MTTS after exposure at 182 dB re: 1 microPa and the other dolphin did not show any shift after exposure to maximum levels of 193 dB re: 1 microPa, and at 0.4 kHz, where no subjects exhibited shifts at levels up to 193 dB re: 1 microPa. The shifts occurred most often at frequencies above the fatiguing stimulus. Dolphins began to exhibit altered behavior at levels of 178-193 dB re: 1 microPa and above; white whales displayed altered behavior at 180-196 dB re: 1 microPa and above. At the conclusion of the study all thresholds were at baseline values. These data confirm that cetaceans are susceptible to temporary threshold shifts (TTS) and that small levels of TTS may be fully recovered.},

abstract = {Humpback whales emit long, patterned vocalizations referred to as ‘songs”. We analyzed songs from 22 recording sessions whick took place from January to April, 1980 on Silver Bank, Dominican Republic. The sequence of patterns (which we call “themes”) in these songs is remarkably regular. In this sample, there were 427 transitions from one theme to another. Only 20 of these did not follow the expected sequence. We present evidence that some themes are sung out of their usual order far more often than others. We also show that when themes are sung out of sequence, the whale is at the surface, blowing. This finding provides a link between the song structure and humpback behavior. Because aspects of the song structure can be linked to breathing, we hypothesize that a function of the songs is to show how long a whale can hold its breath, and that the duration of a song may be an indication of stamina and physical condition.},

abstract = {Biases in the measurements of spatial distribution of fish schools and their consequences for school biomass estimates during conventional acoustic surveys are mainly due to vertical and lateral avoidance of the vessel. In this paper, we quantify school avoidance during an acoustic survey carried out from 13 to 29 May 1994 in the Catalan Sea. From a lateral multi-beam sonar the geometric characteristics (depth, length, width, height, surface, and volume) of 1268 schools were obtained. The 60 beams (1.5{\{}degrees{\}}x15{\{}degrees{\}}) of the sonar scanned a vertical plane from 0{\{}degrees{\}} to 90{\{}degrees{\}}, perpendicular to the vessel path within a range of 100 m. Within this plane, the projected area ensonified by the echo-sounder used aboard for acoustic evaluation was evaluated to simulate a comparison between the sonar and the echo-sounder. The results have enabled us to improve our knowledge on the vertical and lateral avoidance patterns of schools in relation to their size, external structure, and their position in the water column, and to quantify the vessel influence on biomass estimated by echo-sounder.},

abstract = {World-wide many cetaceans drown incidentally in fishing nets. To reduce the unwanted bycatch in gillnets, pingers (acoustic alarms) have been developed that are attached to the nets. In the European Union, pingers will be made compulsory in some areas in 2005 and in others in 2007. However, pingers may effect non-target marine fauna such as fish. Therefore in this study, the effects of seven commercially-available pingers on the behaviour of five North Sea fish species in a large tank were quantified. The species tested were: sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), pout (Trisopterus luscus), thicklip mullet (Chelon labrosus), herring (Clupea harengus), and cod (Gadus morhua). The fish were housed as single-species schools of 9-13 individuals in a tank. The behaviour of fish in quiet periods was compared with their behaviour during periods with active pingers. The results varied both between pingers and between fish species. Sea bass decreased their speed in response to one pinger and swam closer to the surface in response to another. Thicklip mullet swam closer to the bottom in response to two pingers and increased their swimming speed in response to one pinger. Herring swam faster in response to one pinger, and pout and cod (close relatives) showed no behavioural responses to any of the pingers. Of the seven pingers tested, four elicited responses in at least one fish species, and three elicited no responses. Whether similar responses would be elicited in these fish species in the wild, and if so, whether such responses would influence the catch rate of fisheries, cannot be derived from the results of this study. However, the results indicate the need for field studies with pingers and fish. Based on the small number of fish species tested, the present study suggests that the higher the frequency of a pinger, the less likely it is to affect the behaviour of marine fish.},

Effects of the LFA sonar on hearing were tested using auditory brainstem responses. Effects were also examined on inner ear morphology using scanning electron microscopy and on nonauditory tissues using general pathology and histopathology. Animals were exposed to a maximum received rms sound pressure level of 193 dB re 1 microPa(2) for 324 or 648 s, an exposure that is far in excess of any exposure a fish would normally encounter in the wild. The most significant effect was a 20-dB auditory threshold shift at 400 Hz. However, the results varied with different groups of trout, suggesting developmental and/or genetic impacts on how sound exposure affects hearing. There was no fish mortality during or after exposure. Sensory tissue of the inner ears did not show morphological damage even several days post-sound exposure. Similarly, gross- and histopathology observations demonstrated no effects on nonauditory tissues.},

This study investigates the effects of exposure to a 730 in.3 airgun array on hearing of three fish species in the Mackenzie River Delta, the northern pike (Esox lucius), broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus), and lake chub (Couesius plumbeus). Fish were placed in cages in the 1.9 m of water and exposed to five or 20 airgun shots, while controls were placed in the same cage but without airgun exposure. Hearing in both exposed and control fish were then tested using the auditory brainstem response (ABR). Threshold shifts were found for exposed fish as compared to controls in the northern pike and lake chub, with recovery within 24 hours of exposure, while there was no threshold shift in the broad whitefish. It is concluded that these three species are not likely to be substantially impacted by exposure to an airgun array used in a river seismic survey. Care must be taken, however, in extrapolation to other species and to fishes exposed to airguns in deeper water or where the animals are exposed to a larger number of airgun shots over a longer period of time.},

abstract = {The spectral and temporal properties of echolocation clicks and the use of clicks for species classification are investigated for five species of free-ranging dolphins found offshore of southern California: short-beaked common (Delphinus delphis), long-beaked common (D. capensis), Risso's (Grampus griseus), Pacific white-sided (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), and bottlenose (Tursiops truncatus) dolphins. Spectral properties are compared among the five species and unique spectral peak and notch patterns are described for two species. The spectral peak mean values from Pacific white-sided dolphin clicks are 22.2, 26.6, 33.7, and 37.3 kHz and from Risso's dolphins are 22.4, 25.5, 30.5, and 38.8 kHz. The spectral notch mean values from Pacific white-sided dolphin clicks are 19.0, 24.5, and 29.7 kHz and from Risso's dolphins are 19.6, 27.7, and 35.9 kHz. Analysis of variance analyses indicate that spectral peaks and notches within the frequency band 24-35 kHz are distinct between the two species and exhibit low variation within each species. Post hoc tests divide Pacific white-sided dolphin recordings into two distinct subsets containing different click types, which are hypothesized to represent the different populations that occur within the region. Bottlenose and common dolphin clicks do not show consistent patterns of spectral peaks or notches within the frequency band examined (1-100 kHz). (C) 2008 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {The vocal repertoire of many delphinid odontocetes includes narrowband tonal whistles used mainly for communication. The aim of this study was to describe the whistle repertoire of short-beaked common dolphins, Delphinus delphis, recorded in the Celtic Sea between May and August 2005 The 1835 whistles recorded were classified into six broad categories and 30 sub-types, of-which simple upsweeps, and downsweeps were the most common. Furthermore, the parameters duration, inflections., steps and various frequency variables were measured. The whistles covered a frequency span from 3.56 kHz to 23.51 kHz and had durations between 0.05 and 2.02 seconds. Whistle parameters varied with behavioural context, group size and between encounters. The whistle repertoire of Celtic Sea common dolphins was compared to that of D. delphis from the Western Approaches of the English Channel, recorded during a survey between January and March 2004. The relative abundances of the broad whistle types did not differ between the two locations, hut most whistle parameters were significantly different: almost all frequency variables measured were significantly higher in English Channel whistles. This may indicate some degree of population Structuring of short-beaked common dolphins around Britain. Alternatively,, the common dolphins in the English Channel may have shifted the frequencies of their vocalizatious up to avoid masking by low-frequency ambient noise produced by high levels of vessel traffic in this area.},

abstract = {The avoidance reactions of fish with respect to a survey vessel were studied during horizontal acoustic applications of a Simrad EY500 split-beam echosounder (120 kHz) in two lakes (Wallersee, Balaton) and two reservoirs (Orl{\'{i}}k, R{\'{i}}mov). Three methods were used to assess the avoidance reaction of fish to the survey vessel: (1) comparison of acoustically detected fish biomass at different distances, (2) determination of the fish direction vector (echogram slope) with respect to the transducer and (3) direct acoustic observation of fish behaviour in front of the moving vessel. Comparing acoustic biomass in order to demonstrate avoidance reactions is limited. All fish were divided in two groups according to the slope of their movement: with a positive value of slope (fish swimming away from the transducer) and with a negative slope (fish swimming towards the transducer). Fish avoidance caused higher slope values. Most avoidance behaviour was found with small fish (target strength, TS {\textless} -40 dB, 22 cm) at distances under 10 m. Only in the clear lake Wallersee were some indications of avoidance up to a distance of 15 m from the survey boat. There were no significant indications of fish avoidance in the Czech reservoirs. Much less avoidance behaviour was found with fish larger than TS {\textgreater} -40 dB. At distances over 10 m, the avoidance of small boats (5-6 m long, 15-25 HP two-stroke engine) appears not to be a serious problem in shallow waters.},

abstract = {We recorded the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in four dolphins (Tursiops truncatus and Delphinus delphis). The ABR evoked by clicks consists of seven waves within 10 msec; two waves often contain dual peaks. The main waves can be identified with those of humans and laboratory mammals; in spite of a much longer path, the latencies of the peaks are almost identical to those of the rat. The dolphin ABR waves increase in latency as the intensity of a sound decreases by only 4 microseconds/decibel(dB) (for clicks with peak power at 66 kHz) compared to 40 microseconds/dB in humans (for clicks in the sonic range). Low-frequency clicks (6-kHz peak power) show a latency increase about 3 times (12 microseconds/dB) as great. Although the dolphin brainstem tracks individual clicks to at least 600 per sec, the latency increases and amplitude decreases with increasing click rates. This effect varies among different waves of the ABR; it is around one-fifth the effect seen in man. The dolphin brain is specialized for handling brief, frequent clicks. A small latency difference is seen between clicks 180 degrees different in phase--i.e., with initial compression vs. initial rarefaction. The ABR can be used to test theories of dolphin sonar signal processing. Hearing thresholds can be evaluated rapidly. Cetaceans that have not been investigated can now be examined, including the great whales, a group for which data are now completely lacking.},

abstract = {We developed a technique that assists in objective identification of pulse and sine components in the Drosophila,melanogaster courtship song. The song was recorded digitally and subjected to wavelet analysis, which decomposed the signal into a series of bands of decreasing frequency in which acoustic power appeared as a function of time. This time-frequency analysis expresses characteristic 'fingerprints' of the pulses, which appear in all frequency bands, and characteristic 'fingerprints' of the sine song, which appear only in the band containing its frequency. Means of the interpulse intervals (IPIs) for each second of 10-min recordings of song in which pulse singing occurred constituted an irregularly sampled time series, intractable to common spectral analysis techniques. Therefore, we took the discrete Fourier transform of this series, which retained all the spectral information in the Fourier coefficients, and used the inverse Fourier transform of these coefficients to yield a new series that was regularly spaced, with an estimate of IPI for each second in the interval. We observed an IPI period of 67.9 s in wild type, 31.1 s in per(O), 45.9 s in per(s), and 72.0 s in per(L). (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic noise may significantly impact exposed marine mammals. This work studied the vocalization response of endangered blue whales to anthropogenic noise sources in the mid-frequency range using passive acoustic monitoring in the Southern California Bight. Blue whales were less likely to produce calls when mid-frequency active sonar was present. This reduction was more pronounced when the sonar source was closer to the animal, at higher sound levels. The animals were equally likely to stop calling at any time of day, showing no diel pattern in their sensitivity to sonar. Conversely, the likelihood of whales emitting calls increased when ship sounds were nearby. Whales did not show a differential response to ship noise as a function of the time of the day either. These results demonstrate that anthropogenic noise, even at frequencies well above the blue whales' sound production range, has a strong probability of eliciting changes in vocal behavior. The long-term implications of disruption in call production to blue whale foraging and other behaviors are currently not well understood.},

abstract = {Sounds produced by northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus) recorded in the Gully, a submarine canyon off Nova Scotia, consisted predominately of clicks. In 428 min of recordings no whistles were heard which could unequivocally be attributed to bottlenose whales. There were two major types of click series, initially distinguished by large differences in received amplitude. Loud clicks (produced by nearby whales socializing at the surface) were rapid, with short and variable interclick intervals (mean 0.07 sec; CV 71{\%}). The frequency spectra of these were variable and often multimodal, with peak frequencies ranging between 2 and 22 kHz (mean 11 kHz, CV 59{\%}). Clicks received at low amplitude (produced by distant whales, presumably foraging at depth) had more consistent interclick intervals (mean 0.40 sec, CV 12.5{\%}), generally unimodal frequency spectra with a mean peak frequency of 24 kHz (CV 7{\%}) and 3 dB bandwidth of 4 kHz. Echolocation interclick intervals may reflect the approximate search distance of an animal, in this case 300 m, comparable to that found for sperm whales. The relationship between click frequency and the size of object being investigated, suggests that 24 kHz would be optimal for an object of approximately 6 cm or more, consistent with the size range of their squid prey.},

This research is designed to provide new science-based approaches for mitigating the risk of sonar to beaked and other whales. The study was conducted at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) range near Andros Island in the Bahamas, where Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) can regularly be detected using passive acoustic monitoring of their echolocation clicks. Tags recorded sound at the whale and behavior of the whale. Data were collected from 10 tag deployments, 6 on Blainville's beaked whales and 4 on pilot whales. 109 hours of data were collected from tags, 74 hours from beaked whales and 34 hours from pilot whales. Playbacks of mid-frequency sonar and killer whale calls were performed on 3 of the tagged whales, 1 beaked whale and 2 pilot whales. The tagged beaked whale responded to both sonar and killer whale sounds by premature cessation of clicking during foraging dives (RL = {\~{}}117 dB re 1 µPa for the killer whale sound, {\~{}}145 dB for the sonar), and an unusually slow and long ascent. },

abstract = {This study describes behavioral changes of wild cetaceans observed during controlled exposures of naval sonar. In 2006 through 2009, 14 experiments were conducted with killer (n = 4), long-finned pilot (n = 6), and sperm (n = 4) whales. A total of 14 6-7 kHz upsweep, 13 1-2 kHz upsweep, and five 1-2 kHz downsweep sonar exposures, as well as seven Silent vessel control exposure sessions and eight playbacks of killer whale sounds were conducted. Sonar signals were transmitted by a towable source that approached each tagged subject from a starting distance of 6 to 8 km with a ramp up of source levels (from 152 to 158 to a maximum of 198 to 214 dB re: 1 $\mu$Pa m). This procedure resulted in a gradual escalation of the sonar received level at the whale, measured by towed hydrophones and by tags that record movement and sound (Dtags). Observers tracked the position of each tagged animal and recorded group-level surface behavior. Two expert panels independently scored the severity of diverse behavioral changes observed during each sonar and control exposure, using the 0 to 9 point severity scale of Southall et al. (2007), and then reached consensus with a third-party moderator. The most severe responses scored (i.e., most likely to affect vital rates) included a temporary separation of a calf from its group, cessation of feeding or resting, and avoidance movements that continued after the sonar stopped transmitting. Higher severity scores were more common during sonar exposure than during Silent control sessions. Scored responses started at lower sound pressure levels (SPLs) for killer whales and were more severe during sonar exposures to killer and sperm whales than to long-finned pilot whales. Exposure sessions with the higher source level of 1 to 2 kHz sonar had more changes and a trend for higher maximum severity than 6 to 7 kHz sessions, but the order of the sessions had no effect. This approach is helpful to standardize the description of behavioral changes that occurred during our experiments and to identify and describe the severity of potential responses of free-ranging cetaceans to sonar.},

abstract = {For over a decade it has been suggested that high intensity anthropogenic sounds, such as sonar, could induce a temporary threshold shift (TTS) in odontocetes. Although TTS has been examined in marine mammals, the temporary physiological effects of sonar sounds have yet to be established. This study explored the effects of high-intensity (up to 203 dB re: 1 µPa), mid-frequency sweeps (2-4 kHz) on the hearing of a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). The goal was to determine if these sounds could induce TTS and what sound exposure levels (SEL; dB re: 1 µPa2s) were necessary for TTS to be induced. Fatiguing sounds were presented to mimic that of mid-frequency sonar. Hearing thresholds were measured before and after exposures using auditory evoked potentials to determine amount of shift and rate of recovery. Temporary threshold shifts of 5-6 dB were measured using SELs of 214 dB, in situations when 15 sonar pings were presented in series. Recovery to normal hearing was rapid, typically within 5 to 10 min. Exposure levels required to induce TTS were high, supporting the notion that relatively short sounds must be of relatively high intensity to induce threshold shifts.},

abstract = {The dynamics of vocal duels between rival male songbirds have been the subject of intense investigation over the last few decades. However, countersinging interactions between females and duetting birds have received considerably less attention. We compared patterns of song type matching in male and female eastern whipbirds, Psophodes olivaceus, using playback experiments to simulate intrusion by solo singing and duetting intruders. Eastern whipbirds sing a repertoire of sex-specific solo song types, which they combine nonrandomly to form specific duet types, initiated exclusively by the male. During playbacks, individuals could sing either a song type that matched the song type of a same-sex rival or one that fitted the song type of their partner. We found markedly different patterns of song type matching between the sexes. Both male and female eastern whipbirds matched the songs of same-sex intruders during solo singing song duels. However, when forming a duet, females selected a song type that fitted the song of their partner in preference to matching the song type of a female rival, whereas males preferentially matched a rival. We suggest that these sex differences in song type matching behaviour are the result of different strategies of mate and territory defence. Rather than being a purely cooperative signal, duets may be the result of sexual conflicts, with females forced to defend their position within the partnership, either by showing commitment to their partner or by deterring female rivals through display of their pair bond status.},

@article{Packard2008a,
abstract = {The field of biological allometry was energized by the publication in 1997 of a theoretical model purporting to explain 3/4-power scaling of metabolic rate with body mass in mammals. This 3/4-power scaling exponent, which was first reported by Max Kleiber in 1932, has been derived repeatedly in empirical research by independent investigators and has come to be known as ;Kleiber's Law'. The exponent was estimated in virtually every instance, however, by fitting a straight line to logarithmic transformations of data and by then re-expressing the resulting equation in the arithmetic scale. Because this traditional method may yield inaccurate and misleading estimates for parameters in the allometric equation, we re-examined the comprehensive data set that led Savage and colleagues to reaffirm the view that the metabolic rate of mammals scales to the 3/4-power of body mass. We found that a straight line fitted to logged data for the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of mammals ranging in size from a 2.4 g shrew to a 3672 kg elephant does not satisfy assumptions underlying the analysis and that the allometric equation obtained by back-transformation underestimates BMR for the largest species in the sample. Thus, the concept of 3/4-power scaling of metabolic rate to body mass is not well supported because the underlying statistical model does not apply to mammalian species spanning the full range in body size. Our findings have important implications with respect to methods and results of other studies that used the traditional approach to allometric analysis.},

Rapidly burgeoning research has identified impacts on individual behaviour and physiology through to community disruption. To date, however, there has been an almost exclusive focus on vertebrates. Not only does their central role in food webs and in fulfilling ecosystem services make imperative our understanding of how invertebrates are impacted by all aspects of environmental change, but also many of their inherent characteristics provide opportunities to overcome common issues with the current anthropogenic noise literature. Here, we begin by explaining why invertebrates are likely to be affected by anthropogenic noise, briefly reviewing their capacity for hearing and providing evidence that they are capable of evolutionary adaptation and behavioural plasticity in response to natural noise sources. We then discuss the importance of quantifying accurately and fully both auditory ability and noise content, emphasizing considerations of direct relevance to how invertebrates detect sounds. We showcase how studying invertebrates can help with the behavioural bias in the literature, the difficulties in drawing strong, ecologically valid conclusions and the need for studies on fitness impacts. Finally, we suggest avenues of future research using invertebrates that would advance our understanding of the impact of anthropogenic noise.},

abstract = {Surface behavior and concurrent underwater vocalizations were recorded for Pacific white-sided dolphins in the Southern California Bight (SCB) over multiple field seasons spanning 3 years. Clicks, click trains, and pulsed calls were counted and classified based on acoustic measurements, leading to the identification of 19 key call features used for analysis. Kruskal-Wallis tests indicated that call features differ significantly across behavioral categories. Previous work had discovered two distinctive click Types (A and B), which may correspond to known subpopulations of Pacific white-side dolphins in the Southern California Bight; this study revealed that animals producing these different click types also differ in both their behavior and vocalization patterns. Click Type A groups were predominantly observed slow traveling and milling, with little daytime foraging, while click Type B groups were observed traveling and foraging. These behavioral differences may be characteristic of niche partitioning by overlapping populations; coupled with differences in vocalization patterns, they may signify that these subpopulations are cryptic species. Finally, random forest decision trees were used to classify behavior based on vocalization data, with rates of correct classification up to 86{\%}, demonstrating the potential for the use of vocalization patterns to predict behavior.},

Consequently, this will affect several important results deduced from the analysis of tracking data, such as the evaluation of the orientation skills and the energy budget of animals or the identification of foraging areas. We conclude that currents should be systematically taken into account to ensure the unbiased interpretation of tracking data, which now play a major role in marine conservation biology.},

abstract = {Abstract  Whereas echolocation in horseshoe bats is well studied, virtually nothing is known about characteristics and function of their communication calls. Therefore, the communication calls produced by a group of captive adult greater horseshoe bats were recorded during various social interactions in a free-flight facility. Analysis revealed that this species exhibited an amazingly rich repertoire of vocalizations varying in numerous spectro-temporal aspects. Calls were classified into 17 syllable types (ten simple syllables and seven composites). Syllables were combined into six types of simple phrases and four combination phrases. The majority of syllables had durations of more than 100 ms with multiple harmonics and fundamental frequencies usually above 20 kHz, although some of them were also audible to humans. Preliminary behavioral observations indicated that many calls were emitted during direct interaction with and in response to social calls from conspecifics without requiring physical contact. Some echolocation-like vocalizations also appeared to clearly serve a communication role. These results not only shed light upon a so far widely neglected aspect of horseshoe bat vocalizations, but also provide the basis for future studies on the neural control of the production of communicative vocalizations in contrast to the production of echolocation pulse sequences.},

abstract = {From October 1996 through September 1998, we used bottom-mounted hydrophone arrays to monitor deep-water areas north and west of the British Isles for songs of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Singing humpbacks were consistently detected between October and March from the Shetland-Faroe Islands south to waters west of the English Channel. Temporal and geographic patterns of song detections, and movements of individually tracked whales, exhibited a southwesterly trend over this period, but with no corresponding northward trend between April and September. These results, together with a review of historical data from this area, suggest that the offshore waters of the British Isles represent a migration corridor for humpbacks, at least some of which summer in Norwegian (and possibly eastern Icelandic) waters. The migratory destination of the detected animals remains unknown, but the limited data suggest that these whales are bound primarily for the West Indies rather than historical breeding areas off the northwestern coast of Africa. Humpbacks detected in British waters after early to mid-March probably do not undertake a full migration to the tropics. These data provide further evidence that singing is not confined to tropical waters in winter, but occurs commonly on migration even in high latitudes.},

Males did not give Type II songs in response to silent mount presentations of predators at the nest, females ignored Type II songs played in the field and nestlings ignored Type II songs played at the nest. Using playbacks of butcherbird calls to males in the presence of predator and nonpredator mounts, we found that males were not more likely to give Type II songs when a predator was near the nest. Despite being commonly uttered in response to predator calls, this vocalization does not appear to be an alarm or predator deterrent. We suggest that the song is a form of male advertisement.},

abstract = {We investigated the feasibility of using a T-POD, a passive acoustic dolphin detector system, to monitor bottlenose dolphins in the Shannon Estuary, Ireland, from 27 June to 18 August 2005. A v.3 T POD, logging alternate minutes, was moored in view of an observation site. Land-based theodolite tracking was used to record the position of the closest animal, school size and activity of the closest dolphin school to the T POD. All cetacean detections on the TPOD synchronous with shore watches in sea states :52 were analysed. A total of 94 schools were observed at distances up to 8000 in from the observer. Acoustic detections corresponded well with visual detections, with 82{\%} of the dolphin schools observed within 500 m of the T-POD detected acoustically. The furthest distance dolphins were observed from the T POD during periods of acoustic detection was 1246 m. Twelve acoustic encounters were logged without corresponding visual detections, four of which may represent false positives. School size did not affect the acoustic detectability of the dolphins, as there was no difference in the size of schools observed with or without corresponding acoustic detections (Kruskal Wallis, P = 0.64). Simillarly no relationship was found between acoustic detections and school sizes at different distances to the T-POD (linear regression P=0.5, r(2)=0.01). Acoustic encounters did not vary in relation to diel patterns (Mann-Whitnet P=0.13) but were related to tidal state (chi(2)=40.2, P=0.00, df=11) with more encounters logged in the 4 h after high water, probably reflecting prey-related changes in habitat use. T-POD detections correlated well with visual observations and although detection is likely to vary according to T POD specification, sensitivity and the conditions at the deployment site, the T-POD is a useful tool that has been shown to offer the possibility of continuous monitoring, something that is difficult to achieve with visual methods alone.},

However, other clupeids, including sardines and anchovies, do not detect ultrasound. The hearing abilities of herring are of particular interest because of their commercial importance, our reliance on acoustics to monitor their populations and behavioural evidence of responses to high-frequency sound by some clupeid species. We measured the hearing sensitivity of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) using the auditory brainstem response and found that they were unable to detect ultrasonic signals at received levels up to 185 dB re 1 microPa. Herring had hearing thresholds at lower frequencies (100-5000 Hz) that were typical of other non-ultrasound-detecting clupeids. This lower-frequency hearing sensitivity could explain the results of several earlier studies showing responses to broadband sounds.},

(1997) and Caulfield et al. (1997) of water quality impacts and the induced mortality to zooplankton. The impact assessment methodology from the earlier studies has been updated to incorporate the extended probit methodology of Sato et al. (2004), and revised mortality relationships based mainly on copepods were developed after a thorough review of publicly available CO2 toxicity data for zooplankton and fish. The impact assessment is conducted for three discharge approaches, each designed to maximize dilution over the water column: a point release of negatively buoyant CO2 hydrate particles from a moving ship; a stationary point release of CO2 hydrate particles forming a sinking plume; and a long, bottom-mounted diffuser discharging buoyant liquid CO2 droplets. Two of these scenarios take advantage of the enhanced dilution offered by CO2 hydrate particles, and are based on ongoing laboratory and field studies on the formation and behavior of such particles (Chow et al., 2008). Overall, results suggest that it is possible with present or near present technology to engineer discharge configurations that achieve sufficient dilution to largely avoid acute impacts. In particular, the moving ship hydrate discharge is identified as the most promising due to its operational flexibility. In addition to lethal effects, sub-lethal and ecosystem effects are discussed qualitatively, though not analyzed quantitatively. The main conclusion from our analysis is that ocean carbon sequestration by direct injection should not be dismissed as a climate change mitigation strategy on the basis of environmental impact alone. Rather, it can be considered as a viable option for further study, especially in regions where geologic sequestration proves impractical.},

abstract = {Nestling birds may honestly signal their need for food to provisioning adults, or begging might be a manipulative attempt to coerce additional food from providers, but in either case, providers respond to an increase in begging with an increase in feeding. We used playback of begging calls recorded from nestlings to determine whether male and female red-winged blackbirds increase their feeding rates in response to an apparent increase in begging. Both females and males fed broods at significantly higher rates after 5-min begging call playbacks than before, although only eight of 30 males were observed to feed nestlings in this study. In contrast, using the same playback design, neither females nor males altered their feeding rates significantly in response to broadcasts of noise. These results and others suggest that begging vocalizations are a basis for short-term adjustments in the rate at which nestling birds are provisioned. These results are also compared with those of a similar study of the same species, in which playback had no significant effect on rates of provisioning.

abstract = {Beaked whales are hypothesized to be particularly sensitive to anthropogenic noise, based on previous strandings and limited experimental and observational data. However, few species have been studied in detail. We describe the underwater behavior of a Baird's beaked whale (Berardius bairdii) from the first deployment of a multi-sensor acoustic tag on this species. The animal exhibited shallow (23 ± 15 m max depth), intermediate (324 ± 49 m), and deep (1138 ± 243 m) dives. Echolocation clicks were produced with a mean inter-click interval of approximately 300 ms and peak frequency of 25 kHz. Two deep dives included presumed foraging behavior, with echolocation pulsed sounds (presumed prey capture attempts) associated with increased maneuvering, and sustained inverted swimming during the bottom phase of the dive. A controlled exposure to simulated mid-frequency active sonar (3.5-4 kHz) was conducted 4 hours after tag deployment, and within 3 minutes of exposure onset, the tagged whale increased swim speed and body movement, and continued to show unusual dive behavior for each of its next three dives, one of each type. These are the first data on the acoustic foraging behavior in this largest beaked whale species, and the first experimental demonstration of a response to simulated sonar.},

abstract = {The deployment of an ever-evolving array of animal-borne telemetry and data logging devices is rapidly increasing our understanding of the movement, behaviour and physiology of a variety species and the complex, and often highly dynamic, environments they use and respond to. The rapid rate at which new technologies, improvements to current technologies and new analytical techniques are being developed has meant that movements, behaviour and physiological processes are being quantified at finer spatial and temporal scales than ever before. The Fourth International Symposium on Bio-logging Science, held on 14–18 March in Hobart, Australia, brought together scientists across multiple disciplines to discuss the latest innovations in technology, applications and analytical techniques in bio-logging science, building on research presented at three previous conferences. Here we present an update on the state of bio-logging research and provide some views on the future of this field of research. Papers were grouped into five theme areas: (i) Southern Ocean ecosystems; (ii) fishery and biodiversity management applications; (iii) from individuals to populations—inferences of population dynamics from individuals; (iv) conservation biology and (v) habitat modelling. Papers reflected wider uptake of newer technologies, with a greater proportion of studies utilising accelerometry and incorporating advances in statistical modelling of behaviour and habitats, especially via state space modelling methods. Environmental data collected by tags at increasing accuracies are now having wider application beyond the bio-logging community, providing important oceanographic data from regions difficult to sample using traditional methodologies. Partnerships between multiple organisations are also now enabling regional assessments of species movements, behaviour and physiology at population scales and will continue to be important for applying bio-logging technologies to species conservation and management applications.},

Each subcomponent of ESME is intended to capture the current state of understanding in the relevant scientific field and to be capable of being updated as the understanding in the field advances. ESME is envisioned to have three primary applications: 1) retrospective studies of historical data, 2) predictive modeling of anticipated outcomes from a given scenario of sound in a marine environment, and 3) prescriptive guidance for research investments and efforts that will likely have the greatest effect on increasing confidence in decisions about underwater sound use and its effects},

abstract = {Early studies that categorized odontocete pulsed sounds had few means of discriminating signals used for biosonar-based foraging from those used for communication. This capability to identify the function of sounds is important for understanding and interpreting behavior; it is also essential for monitoring and mitigating potential disturbance from human activities. Archival tags were placed on free-ranging Grampus griseus to quantify and discriminate between pulsed sounds used for echolocation-based foraging and those used for communication. Two types of rapid click-series pulsed sounds, buzzes and burst pulses, were identified as produced by the tagged dolphins and classified using a Gaussian mixture model based on their duration, association with jerk (i.e., rapid change of acceleration), and temporal association with click trains. Buzzes followed regular echolocation clicks and coincided with a strong jerk signal from accelerometers on the tag. They consisted of series averaging 359-210 (mean +/- SD) clicks with an increasing repetition rate and relatively low amplitude. Burst pulses consisted of relatively short click series averaging 45-54 clicks with decreasing repetition rate and longer inter-click interval that were less likely to be associated with regular echolocation and the jerk signal. These results suggest that the longer, relatively lower amplitude, jerk-associated buzzes are used in this species to capture prey, mostly during the bottom phase of foraging dives, as seen in other odontocetes. In contrast, the shorter, isolated burst pulses that are generally emitted by the dolphins while at or near the surface are used outside of a direct, known foraging context.},

abstract = {Studies have documented effects of drag created by data-logging units attached to seals, but the effect of visual stimuli from such units has not been investigated. We evaluated potential effects of camera attachment including near-infrared flash operation by comparing the diving behaviour of 15 female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) with cameras and 10 seals without cameras. Irrespective of the presence of the camera or flash, all seals exhibited an expected diel dive pattern with shallower, shorter dives, less time at the bottom of a dive, and slower ascent and descent rates at night following krill vertical migration. We also observed a previously unreported foraging trip dive pattern with faster ascents and descents near the end of trips. With cameras present, dive duration and bottom time increased and ascents were slower. During flash operation, dive duration increased and bottom time remained constant throughout the day contrary to the expected diel trend. Also during flash operation, bottom time was shorter at the beginning of a foraging trip and dives were deeper, with longer duration and bottom time later in the trip. We were unable to conclude whether the flash emission spectrum overlapped with the visual sensitivity of seals and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) since visual sensitivity data for seals and krill at longer wavelengths were not available. It is possible that the flash was bright enough for the seals or krill to detect; however, although there was a change in diving behaviour observed during flash operation this behaviour was within the range of values normally observed for these seals and should not cause ethical concern.

The interaction between toxicological results (Zn, Cd, Cu, Fe, Se, Hg), stable isotope data (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) and the most common pathological findings, namely emaciation and lesions of the respiratory system, were investigated in 132 porpoises collected along the coasts of northern France, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Iceland and Norway between 1994 and 2001. The body condition of harbour porpoises stranded on the French, Belgian and German coasts was poor compared to that of by-catch individuals from Iceland and Norway, as reflected by blubber thickness and hepatic to total body-mass ratio. High Zn and Hg concentrations were observed in some porpoises collected along the southern North Sea coast compared to by-catch individuals from Iceland, Norway and the Baltic Sea. Increasing Zn levels were observed with deteriorating health condition (emaciation and bronchopneumonia), while Hg increases were not significant. The increases were not related to shrinking liver mass which remained unchanged. These observations indicate a general redistribution of trace metals within the organs (muscles and blubber to liver), as a result of protein and lipid catabolism. Muscle delta(13)C and delta(15)N values remained unchanged with deteriorating body condition. Cd concentrations were associated only with age and low delta(15)N values, indicating that high Cd concentrations in Iceland and Norway porpoises may be partly diet-related, i.e. a result of Cd contaminated prey.},

Whales were assigned to one of three activities (feeding, travelling or other), and sound recordings were made in their proximity with a single hydrophone and a digital audiotape (DAT) recorder. A quantitative analysis of the production of pulsed calls, whistles and echolocation clicks in the three activities revealed that there was a significant effect of activity on the production of these sound types. Both killer whales in Icelandic and Norwegian waters produced high rates of clicks and calls during feeding and low rates of click, calls and whistles during travelling. The differences can be used as acoustical markers and provides new possibilities for acoustic monitoring of killer whales in these areas. Based on the similarity between their prey choice, hunting strategies, phenotype and acoustic behaviour, we suggest that the killer whales in Icelandic and Norwegian waters belong to the same ecotype: Scandinavian herring-eating killer whales.},

Mean delta(13)C values differed significantly between male and female harbour porpoises suggesting a trophic segregation between sexes with a more coastal distribution for females at least during their gestation and nursing periods. Hepatic Hg was correlated to delta(13)C measurements, reflecting a different exposure linked to coastal vs offshore feeding habitats. A geographical comparison with existing data from other regions showed general low levels of Hg, Cd, Cu and Zn in the tissues of harbour porpoises from the Black Sea compared to other Atlantic and North Sea areas.

The stimuli used were custom sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) tone-bursts, and the AEP responses were collected, averaged and analyzed to quantify the animal's physiological response and, thereby, hearing thresholds. The infant animal showed a wide range of best sensitivity, with the lowest threshold of 49.5 dB re. 1 mu Pa at 90 kHz. The audiograrn showed a typical mammalian U-shape with a gradual, low-frequency slope of 16.4 dB octave(-1) and a sharp high-frequency increase of 95 dB octave(-1). When compared with an audiogram of an older Risso's dolphin obtained using behavioral methods, the threshold values at upper frequencies were much lower for this infant animal, and this infant heard higher frequencies. These results redefine the hearing capabilities of Risso's dolphins by demonstrating very high-frequency sensitivity.},

abstract = {Aggregations of fish around fish aggregation devices (FADs) have been widely described in the literature; most commercial catches of tuna by surface fisheries are performed around FADs, taking advantage of this behaviour. The meeting point hypothesis (MPH) suggests that fish could make use of FADs to increase the chance of encounters between conspecifics, helping individuals to form larger schools. To attempt a validation of the MPH, we performed an experiment in the field to test the following predictions: (1) fish spend more time at FADs than at any other random points and therefore aggregate around FADs, and (2) fish arrive at FADs as isolated individuals or in small groups and leave them in larger groups. Our investigation involved acoustic telemetry techniques commonly used to observe fish at FADs. The study was carried out on a small pelagic fish species, the bigeye scad, Selar crumenophthalmus, in Saint-Paul's Bay (Reunion Island). Our results validated our two predictions: FADs acted as retention points, increasing the encounter rate of fish and enhancing schooling behaviour, thereby supporting the meeting point hypothesis. FADs could be beneficial to the fitness of the associated fish, promote increased school size and hence confer the advantages of being in a larger group. The impact of the deployment of large number of FADs in some ocean regions is reinterpreted in light of our results.},

Seven of twenty single-species schools of L. borealis produced click and pulsed vocalizations. No whistles were detected during any of the encounters. Clicks associated with burst-pulse vocalizations were lower in frequency and shorter in duration than clicks associated with echolocation. All burst-pulse sounds were produced in a series containing 6-18 individual burst-pulses. These burst-pulse series were stereotyped and repeated. A total of eight unique burst-pulse series were detected. Variation in the temporal characteristics of like units compared across repeated series was less than variation among all burst-pulses. These stereotyped burst-pulse series may play a similar communicative role as do stereotyped whistles found in other delphinid species. (c) 2007 Acoustical Society of America.},

Experienced marine mammal observers conducted line-transect surveys and monitored marine mammal behavior visually and acoustically in a 70 X 70 km square centered on the transmission site. Thirty-nine groups of cetaceans and 19 of pinnipeds were sighted from both vessels before the start of transmissions. Thirty-nine groups of cetaceans and 23 of pinnipeds were sighted during transmissions. Blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (B. physalus), and sperm (Physeter macrocephalus) whales were sighted during the base line period; blue, sperm, and possibly sei (B. borealis) whales were sighted during the transmission period. More schools of hourglass dolphins (Lagenorhynchus cruciger) were sighted during transmissions, but fewer groups of pilot whales (Globicephala melas), southern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon planifrons), and minke whales (B. acutorostrata). The density of all cetaceans was 0.0157 groups/km(2) before the transmissions and 0.0166 groups/km(2) during. Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) and southern,elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) were seen, but not in sufficient numbers to estimate abundance. One blue whale tracked before, during and after a transmission changed respiration and reorientation rates, but did not avoid the source detectably. Sperm whales and pilot whales were heard in 23{\%} of 1181 min of baseline acoustic surveys; but in none of 1939 min during the transmission period. Both species were heard within 48 h after the end of the test.},

abstract = {Geographical range contraction is a fundamental ecological characteristic of species population decline, but relatively little investigation has been conducted into general trends in the dynamic properties of range collapse. The Yangtze River dolphin or baiji (Lipotes vexillifer), probably the first large mammal species to have become extinct in over 50 years, was believed to have experienced major range collapse during its decline through progressive large-scale range contraction and fragmentation. This range-collapse model is challenged by a new dataset of 406 baiji last-sighting records collected from across the baiji's historical range during an interview survey of Yangtze fishing communities. Although baiji regional abundance may have varied across its range, analyses of the extensive new sighting series provide comprehensive evidence that baiji population decline was not associated with any major contraction in geographical range across the middle{\^{a}}€“lower Yangtze drainage, even in the decade immediately before probable global extinction of the species. Extinction risk in baiji was therefore seemingly not related to evidence of range collapse. Baiji apparently underwent large-scale periodic and seasonal movements across their range, and we propose that range contraction and fragmentation may not be general biogeographic characteristics for declining populations of mobile species in connected landscapes.},

abstract = {The behavior of humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, exposed to playback of low-frequency sounds, was examined to test whether animals would respond to this signal when received sound levels exceeded 120 dB re: 1 mu Pa. The source signal was an M-sequence (essentially a sine wave with a series of phase reversals) centered at 75 Hz with a 30-Hz bandwidth. Behavior and movements of whales were described before, during, and after playback. Eighty-five trials were conducted, of which 50 had an experimental condition of M-sequence playback. Thirty-four were no-sound controls and a single trial used a playback of the Alaska humpback whale feeding call. The received playback sound level at the whales ranged from ambient level (approximate to 90 dB) to 130 dB re: 1 mu Pa (60-90 Hz). A comparison revealed no difference in whale tracks and bearings between control and playback conditions. Behavior rates were examined statistically using independent variables describing pod composition, nearby vessels, and playback sound level. Natural variables of pod composition were the most important factors predicting behavior rates. Vessels had a larger impact and affected more behavioral variables than playback. A slight increase in the duration and distance between successive surfacings was found as the received playback sound level increased. Eleven playbacks in which whales passed within the 120-dB isopleth yielded only three potential responses (one movement away and two toward the sound source) and eight nonresponses. Overall, subtle responses to M-sequence playbacks could only be detected statistically, but the biological significance of these responses is uncertain.},

abstract = {The standard approach to most allometric research is to gather data on a biological function and a measure of body size, convert the data to logarithms, display the new values in a bivariate plot, and then fit a straight line to the transformations by the method of least squares. The slope of the fitted line provides an estimate for the allometric (or scaling) exponent, which often is interpreted in the context of underlying principles of structural and functional design. However, interpretations of this sort are based on the implicit assumption that the original data conform with a power function having an intercept of 0 on a plot with arithmetic coordinates. Whenever this assumption is not satisfied, the resulting estimate for the allometric exponent may be seriously biased and misleading. The problem of identifying an appropriate function is compounded by the logarithmic transformations, which alter the relationship between the original variables and frequently conceal the presence of outliers having an undue influence on properties of the fitted equation, including the estimate for the allometric exponent. Much of the current controversy in allometric research probably can be traced to substantive biases introduced by investigators who followed standard practice. We illustrate such biases with examples taken from the literature and outline a general methodology by which the biases can be minimized in future research.},

abstract = {1. The electrical responses of single auditory nerve fibres or cochlear hair cells were recorded in the isolated half-head of the turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans. Responses to sound stimuli presented to the tympanum could be recorded for at least 4 hr after isolation. 2. Impulses were recorded extracellularly from single auditory nerve fibres. For tones of suprathreshold intensity the impulses occurred with a preferred phase relation (i.e. they were phase-locked) to the cycles of the sound stimulus. Nerve fibres had sharp tuning curves (Q10 db = 0{\{}middle dot{\}}5-7{\{}middle dot{\}}5) with single characteristic frequencies (c.f.) ranging from about 30 to 700 Hz. Best threshold sensitivities of fibres at their c.f. were in the region of 30-40 db sound pressure level with respect to 20 {\{}micro{\}}Pa. 3. Intracellular recordings were made from hair cells in the basilar papilla. Following injection of a fluorescent dye into a cell through the recording electrode, the dye was localized in a single hair cell in a transverse section of the cochlea. 4. Hair cells had resting potentials of about -50 mV, and, to low frequency tones, gave periodic responses graded with the intensity and frequency of the stimulus. Recordings were obtained from cells with characteristic frequencies between 70 and 670 Hz. 5. The voltage response to a pure tone at low sound pressure was sinusoidal for all frequencies of stimulation; at higher sound pressures a number of non-linearities were apparent in the response wave form. One of these was a steady depolarizing component, which, relative to the periodic component of the response, was most prominent at high frequencies. 6. The amplitude of the response evoked in a hair cell by a low intensity tone was linearly related to the sound pressure; for loud sounds, the response eventually reached a saturating amplitude, which in some cells was as great as 30-45 mV peak-to-peak. 7. The linear sensitivity of a hair cell is defined as the r.m.s. voltage for a linear response of the cell at its c.f. divided by the sound pressure at the tympanum. In the most sensitive cells this value was 30-90 mV/Pa. 8. If the frequency selectivity of a hair cell was expressed in terms of the sound pressure needed to produce a constant amplitude of response, the sharpness of this frequency selectivity was found to be virtually independent of the response criterion for responses between 1 and 10 mV; in the cells which gave the largest responses, the frequency selectivity expressed in this way was comparable to that of the nerve fibres. Cells with smaller maximum responses often had broader tuning curves. 9. Responses of hair cells to short low intensity tone bursts at the c.f. built up approximately exponentially during the tone, and decayed away exponentially when the tone was terminated. The terminal oscillations were at the c.f. of the cell, and independent of the frequency of stimulation. 10. From the time constant of the build up and decay of the linear response to a tone burst at the c.f. the sharpness of tuning of the cell was estimated and found to agree with that obtained from the responses of the cell to continuous tones. The most highly tuned cells had quality factors (Q3 db) in the range 5-10. 11. The c.f. of a hair cell was correlated with its position along the basilar membrane. Low frequency hair cells were located towards the apical or lagenar end and high frequency cells were found towards the basal or saccular end. On the assumption of an exponential distribution of c.f. with distance, each octave occupied about 94 {\{}micro{\}}m along the membrane. 12. A hair cell's response to a click was a decaying oscillation at the characteristic frequency of the cell. From the initial polarity of the responses to condensation and rarefaction clicks it was concluded that the hair cell depolarized as a result of movements of the basilar membrane towards the scala vestibuli, and hyperpolarized for motion towards the scala tympani. 13. In the absence of deliberate sound stimulation, the hair cell voltage fluctuated continuously a out its mean level. The principal frequency components in the noise were concentrated around the c.f. of the cell. The voltage noise in the hair cells showed no significant cross-correlation with sound pressure fluctuations at the tympanum.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Vessel collisions contribute to the anthropogenic mortality of several threatened marine species including turtles, manatees, dugongs and whales, but scant data exist to inform the design of optimal mitigation measures. We conducted a field experiment to evaluate behavioural responses of green turtles Chelonia mydas to a research vessel approaching at slow, moderate or fast speed (4, 11 and 19 km h–1, respectively). Data were recorded for 1890 encounters with turtles sighted within 10 m of the research vessel's track. The proportion of turtles that fled to avoid the vessel decreased significantly as vessel speed increased, and turtles that fled from moderate and fast approaches did so at significantly shorter distances from the vessel than turtles that fled from slow approaches. Our results imply that vessel operators cannot rely on turtles to actively avoid being struck by the vessel if it exceeds 4 km h–1. As most vessels travel much faster than 4 km h–1 in open waters, we infer that mandatory speed restrictions will be necessary to reduce the cumulative risk of vessel strike to green turtles in key habitats subject to frequent vessel traffic.},

abstract = {To improve our understanding of how dolphins use acoustic signals in the wild, a three-hydrophone towed array was used to investigate the spatial occurrence of Hawaiian spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) relative to each other as they produced whistles, burst pulses, and echolocation clicks. Groups of approximately 30 to 60 animals were recorded while they traveled and socialized in nearshore waters off Oahu, Hawaii. Signaling animals were localized using time of arrival difference cues on the three channels. Sequences of whistles occurred between dolphins separated by significantly greater distances than animals producing burst pulses. Whistles typically originated from dolphins spaced widely apart (median = 23 m), supporting the hypothesis that whistles play a role in maintaining contact between animals in a dispersed group. Burst pulses, on the other hand, usually came from animals spaced closer to one another (median = 14 m), suggesting they function as a more intimate form of signaling between adjacent individuals. The spacing between echolocating animals was more variable and exhibited a bimodal distribution. Three quarters of echolocating animals were separated by 10 m or more, suggesting that the task of vigilance in a pod may not be shared equally by all members at all times.

abstract = {Envelope following responses were measured in two bottlenose dolphins in response to sinusoidal amplitude modulated tones with carrier frequencies from 20 to 60 kHz and modulation rates from 100 to 5,000 Hz. One subject had elevated hearing thresholds at higher frequencies, with threshold differences between subjects varying from +/-4 dB at 20 and 30 kHz to +40 dB at 50 and 60 kHz. At each carrier frequency, evoked response amplitudes and phase angles were plotted with respect to modulation frequency to construct modulation rate transfer functions. Results showed that both subjects could follow the stimulus envelope components up to at least 2,000 Hz, regardless of carrier frequency. There were no substantial differences in modulation rate transfer functions for the two subjects suggesting that reductions in hearing sensitivity did not result in reduced temporal processing ability. In contrast to earlier studies, phase data showed group delays of approximately 3.5 ms across the tested frequency range, implying generation site(s) within the brainstem rather than the periphery at modulation rates from 100 to 1,600 Hz. This discrepancy is believed to be the result of undersampling of the modulation rate during previous phase measurements.},

Atlantic white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus acutus, harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena, white beaked-dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris, grey seal Halichoerus grypus stranded on French Channel and Irish coasts. White-beaked dolphins, harbour porpoises, white-sided dolphins, common and striped dolphins display the same relative and decreasing trophic position, as measured by delta(15)N values, along both the Irish and French channel coasts, reflecting conservative trophic habits between these two places. Hepatic and renal Cd concentrations were significantly correlated to muscle delta(13)C and delta(15)N values while Hg, Zn and Cu did not. These results suggest that Cd accumulation is partly linked to the diet while other factors Such as age or body condition might explain Hg, Zn or Cu variability in marine mammals. Combined stable isotope and trace metal analyses appear to be useful tools for the study of marine mammal ecology. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The bearded seal, Erignathus barbatus, is an ice breeding phocid that mates in the water. The most detailed studies of male behaviour among aquatic-mating phocids have concentrated primarily on temperate breeding harbour seals, Phoca vitulina, where females are dependent on stable substrates, rock or sand, for parturition. In contrast, female bearded seals give birth on ice floes or the edge of fast ice, a highly unstable substrate. In this study, spatial and temporal patterns of male bearded seal vocalisations were studied in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard from April 1999 to the end of May 2000. Males vocalised during a discrete 90-day period from early April to mid July, no calls were heard at any other time of the year during this study. Vocalisations increased in duration towards the middle of the mating season in late May, although no change was seen in inter vocal intervals of individuals. The frequency of occurrence of vocalisations varied significantly with the diel cycle. Vocalisations increased in number from 16:00 hrs onward into the 'night', peaking around 04:00 hrs. This peak coincides with the period when most females are in the water. Female bearded seals were found throughout Kongsfjorden. Their distribution at any particular point in time depends on the availability of suitable haul-out sites (i.e. ice conditions), which are highly variable over time spans as short as a few hours. Males vocalised in higher densities around the fjord entrances and may use these 'geographical bottlenecks' to intercept passing females. We suggest that male distribution may reflect the unpredictable nature of female distribution. Aquatic mating phocids appear to exhibit variations in reproductive strategies, including spatial arrangements of displaying males, which reflect the varying constraints imposed on female movement patterns by their local habitats and ecological requirements.},

However, analysis methods for these data have not developed at a similar pace, largely due to a lack of suitable candidate models, coupled with the technical difficulties of fitting such models to data. To facilitate a general modeling framework, we propose that complex movement paths can be conceived as a series of movement strategies among which animals transition as they are affected by changes in their internal and external environment. We synthesize previously existing and novel methodologies to develop a general suite of mechanistic models based on biased and correlated random walks that allow different behavioral states for directed (e.g., migration), exploratory (e.g., dispersal), area-restricted (e.g., foraging), and other types of movement. Using this “toolbox” of nested model components, multistate movement models may be custom-built for a wide...},

abstract = {Loggerhead turtles ( Caretta caretta) are known to migrate towards fixed, individually-specific residential feeding grounds. To study their spatial behaviour and their navigational ability, five loggerheads nesting in South Africa were captured when about to start their postnesting migration and tracked by satellite after having been displaced from their usual migratory route. The first turtle, released south of Madagascar about 1,148 km from the capture site, moved west up to mainland Africa and then reached her feeding grounds by following the coast. A second turtle, released farther away (2,140 km) close to La R{\'{e}}union Island, stopped for some time on the Madagascar east coast, then turned southwards to round the island and regain the African mainland in the northwest, without however allowing us to establish the location of her residential grounds. Three other turtles were released off the Tanzanian coast, 2,193 km north of their nesting area, at the northern edge of the distribution of the feeding grounds along the African coast. All of them headed north, and one turtle found her residential grounds located north of the release site. The other two females started long-distance oceanic wanderings in which they crossed nearly the entire Indian Ocean, apparently being transported by the sea currents of the region. We conclude that adult loggerhead turtles are apparently unable to compensate for the displacement and can return to a pelagic life style characteristic of juvenile turtles. These findings suggest that South African loggerheads rely on simple orientation mechanisms, such as the use of the coastline, as a guide, and compass orientation, possibly integrated by spatiotemporal programmes and/or acquired maps of familiar sites.},

The statistical examination of the relationship between the sensory setae and body size showed an increase in both the length and number of statocyst hair cells as the animal grows. In view of this finding, the response of the statocyst organ to a 500 Hz tone burst was recorded from four specimens from each size class using two subcutaneous electrodes, positioned in the carapace close to the supraoesophageal ganglion and statocyst. Neither body size nor the number of afferents in the statocyst has any significant impact on the amplitude of AEPs in response to the 500 Hz tone burst. The findings of this study show that P. serratus is capable of hearing a 500 Hz tone regardless of body size, a finding that is of ecological importance when considering the effect of anthropogenic sound on crustaceans.},

abstract = {High background noise is an important obstacle in successful signal detection and perception of an intended acoustic signal. To overcome this problem, many animals modify their acoustic signal by increasing the repetition rate, duration, amplitude or frequency range of the signal. An alternative method to ensure successful signal reception, yet to be tested in animals, involves the use of two different types of signal, where one signal type may enhance the other in periods of high background noise. Humpback whale communication signals comprise two different types: vocal signals, and surface-generated signals such as 'breaching' or 'pectoral slapping'. We found that humpback whales gradually switched from primarily vocal to primarily surface-generated communication in increasing wind speeds and background noise levels, though kept both signal types in their repertoire. Vocal signals have the advantage of having higher information content but may have the disadvantage of loosing this information in a noisy environment. Surface-generated sounds have energy distributed over a greater frequency range and may be less likely to become confused in periods of high wind-generated noise but have less information content when compared with vocal sounds. Therefore, surface-generated sounds may improve detection or enhance the perception of vocal signals in a noisy environment.},

abstract = {It is essential to test a priori scientific hypotheses with independent data, not least to partly negate factors such as gene-specific base composition biases misleading our models. Seven new gene segments and sequences plus Bayesian likelihood phylogenetic methods were used to compare and test five recent placental phylogenies. These five phylogenies are similar to each other, yet quite different from Fthose of previously proposed trees, and span Waddell et al. [Syst. Biol. 48 (1999) 1] to Murphy et al. [Science 294 (2001b) 2348]. Trees for RAGI, gamma-fibrinogen, ND6, mt-tRNA, mt-RNA, c-MYC, epsilon-globin, and GHR are significantly congruent with the four main groups of mammals common to the five phylogenies, i.e., Afrotheria, Laurasiatheria, Euarchontoglires, Xenarthra plus Boreoeutheria (Laurasiatheria plus Euarchontoglires). Where these five a priori phylogenies differ, remain areas generally hard to resolve with the new sequences. The root remains ambiguous and does not reject a basal Afrotheria (the Exafroplacentalia hypothesis), Afrotheria plus Xenarthra together with basal (Atlantogenata), or Epitheria (Xenarthra basal) convincingly. Good evidence is found that Eulipotyphla is monophyletic and is located at the base of Laurasiatheria. The shrew mole., Uropsilus, is found to cluster consistently with other moles, while Solenodon may be the sister taxa to all other eulipotyphlans. Support is found for a probable sister pairing of just hedgehogs/gymnures and shrews. Relationships within Afrotheria, except the Paenungulata clade, remain hard to resolve, although there is congruent support for Afroinsectiphillia (aardvark, elephant shrews golden moles, and tenrecs). A first-time use is made of MCMC enacted general time-reversible (GTR) amino acid and codon-based models for general tree selection. Even with ND6, a GTR amino acid model provided resolution of fine features, such as the sister group relationship of walrus to Otatriidae, and with BRCA a more reasonable rooting. An extensive analysis of GHR sequences reveals strong congruence with prior phylogenies, including strong support for Eulipotyphla, and good resolution within Rodentia. A codon model gives a worse likelihood than a nucleotide model and sometimes switches support, e.g., with RAG1 + gamma-fibrinogen from a hyrax-sirenian association to support for Tethytheria. An analysis of the concatenated data is in accordance with well-resolved features of the gene trees. Taken all together, this work suggests that we are on the right path finding strong confirmation of prior phylogenies. However, with the use of robust criteria for assessing trees (i.e., not Bayesian posteriors), it is apparent parts of the tree remain hard to resolve. Since our current models are far from fitting the sequence data, we should continue with our exploratory analyses to arrive at a refined set of hypotheses for future testing using more model independent characters (e.g., rare indels. gene rearrangement, and SINE data).

This study develops a sampling and extraction protocol for template DNA from faecal material collected in a marine environment from small cetaceans. DNA was extracted from faecal material of free-ranging Atlantic spotted dolphins (Stenella frontalis) and subsequently tested for its suitability in molecular investigations by amplifying both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. The resulting mitochondrial sequences were found to closely match known S. frontalis haplotypes. Three microsatellite loci were amplified and fall within the expected size range for cetaceans. Mother and calf families previously assigned by observation were genetically confirmed using both mitochondrial haplotype and allele sharing between the mother and offspring. The protocol effectively collects and extracts dolphin DNA from faecal samples and enables species identification as well as confirmation of genetic relatedness and should be considered as a noninvasive alternative to current protocols.},

abstract = {Many prey species gather together to approach and harass their predators despite the associated risks. While mobbing, prey usually utter calls and previous experiments have demonstrated that mobbing calls can convey information about risk to conspecifics. However, the risk posed by predators also differs between predator categories. The ability to communicate predator category would be adaptive because it would allow other mobbers to adjust their risk taking. I tested this idea in Siberian jays , a group-living bird species, by exposing jay groups to mounts of three hawk and three owl species of varying risks. Groups immediately approached to mob the mount and uttered up to 14 different call types. Jays gave more calls when mobbing a more dangerous predator and when in the presence of kin. Five call types were predator-category-specific and jays uttered two hawk-specific and three owl-specific call types. Thus, this is one of the first studies to demonstrate that mobbing calls can simultaneously encode information about both predator category and the risk posed by a predator. Since antipredator calls of Siberian jays are known to specifically aim at reducing the risk to relatives, kin-based sociality could be an important factor in facilitating the evolution of predator-category-specific mobbing calls.},

abstract = {Male Club-winged Manakins, (Aves: Pipridae), produce a sustained tonal sound with specialized wing feathers. The fundamental frequency of the sound produced in nature is approximately 1500 Hz and is hypothesized to result from excitation of resonance in the feathers' hypertrophied shafts. We used laser Doppler vibrometry to determine the resonant properties of male Club-winged Manakin's wing feathers, as well as those of two unspecialized manakin species. The modified wing feathers exhibit a response peak near 1500 Hz, and unusually high -values (a measure of resonant tuning) for biological objects ( up to 27). The unmodified wing feathers of the Club-winged Manakin do not exhibit strong resonant properties when measured in isolation. However, when measured still attached to the modified feathers (nine feathers held adjacent by an intact ligament), they resonate together as a unit near 1500 Hz, and the wing produces a second harmonic of similar or greater amplitude than the fundamental. The feathers of the control species also exhibit resonant peaks around 1500 Hz, but these are significantly weaker, the wing does not resonate as a unit and no harmonics are produced. These results lend critical support to the resonant stridulation hypothesis of sound production in .},

abstract = {This paper identifies several serious problems with the widespread use of ANOVAs for the analysis of categorical outcome variables such as forced-choice variables, question-answer accuracy, choice in production (e.g. in syntactic priming research), et cetera. I show that even after applying the arcsine-square-root transformation to proportional data, ANOVA can yield spurious results. I discuss conceptual issues underlying these problems and alternatives provided by modern statistics. Specifically, I introduce ordinary logit models (i.e. logistic regression), which are well-suited to analyze categorical data and offer many advantages over ANOVA. Unfortunately, ordinary logit models do not include random effect modeling. To address this issue, I describe mixed logit models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models for binomially distributed outcomes, Breslow {\&} Clayton, 1993), which combine the advantages of ordinary logit models with the ability to account for random subject and item effects in one step of analysis. Throughout the paper, I use a psycholinguistic data set to compare the different statistical methods.},

abstract = {The human contribution to ambient noise in the ocean has increased over the past 50 years, and is dominated by low-frequency (LF) sound (frequencies {\textless} 1000 Hz) from shipping, oil and gas development, defence-related and research activities. Mysticete whales, including six endangered species, mag; be at risk from this noise pollution because all species produce and probably perceive low-frequency sound. We conducted a manipulative field experiment to test the effects of loud, LF noise on foraging fin blue (B. musculus) and (Balaenoptera physalus) whales off San Nicolas Island, California. Naive observers used a combination of attached tracking devices, ship-based surveys, aerial surveys, photo-identification and passive monitoring of vocal behaviour to examine the behaviour and distribution of whales when a loud LF source (US Navy SURTASS LFA) was and was not transmitting. During transmission, 12-30{\%} of the estimated received levels of LFA of whales in the study area exceeded 140 dB re 1 mua. However, whales continued to be seen foraging in the region. Overall, whale encounter rates and diving behaviour appeared to be more strongly linked to changes in prey abundance associated with oceanographic parameters than to LF sound transmissions. In some cases, whale vocal behaviour was significantly different between experimental and non-experimental periods.. However, these differences were nor consistent and did not appear to be related to LF sound transmissions. Rt the spatial and temporal scales examined, we found no obvious responses of whales to a loud, anthropogenic, LF sound. We suggest that the cumulative effects of anthropogenic LF noise over larger temporal and spatial scales than examined here may be a more important consideration for management agencies.},

abstract = {In the North Atlantic, 14 regional subpopulations have been proposed for the harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena (Linnaeus, 1758). To what degree these populations experience genetic interchange is relatively unknown, particularly on the larger scale of the North Atlantic as a whole. With the recent completion of several regional genetic studies on population structure of the harbor porpoise in the North Atlantic, came the opportunity to combine datasets in an effort to broaden the geographic scope of focus. Three datasets comprised of mitochondrial DNA control region sequences, representing the Northeast and Northwest Atlantic regions were pooled and reanalyzed to examine the degree of trans-Atlantic exchange among harbor porpoise populations, and to examine the evolutionary history of the species in the North Atlantic. The movement of harbor porpoises across the Atlantic appears to occur at a low level. Genetic variability in the Northeast Atlantic is significantly lower than in the Northwest Atlantic, and may indicate a more recent recolonization for the Northeast Atlantic. The star phylogeny of northeastern haplotypes, with a number of rare haplotypes closely related to the most abundant type, indicates a recent population expansion. A disjunction in haplotypic frequencies between the Northeast and Northwest Atlantic probably occurs east of Greenland, but the exact location and source of the disjunction has yet to be determined.},

Here we show that consistently enhanced rates of net primary production (NPP) are sustained by a C-cascade through the root-microbe-soil system; increases in the flux of C belowground under elevated CO₂ stimulated microbial activity, accelerated the rate of soil organic matter decomposition and stimulated tree uptake of N bound to this SOM. This process set into motion a positive feedback maintaining greater C gain under elevated CO₂ as a result of increases in canopy N content and higher photosynthetic N-use efficiency. The ecosystem-level consequence of the enhanced requirement for N and the exchange of plant C for N belowground is the dominance of C storage in tree biomass but the preclusion of a large C sink in the soil.},

abstract = {In mating systems with intense male-male competition for mates, males may coerce females into matings that impose fitness costs. Females able to alleviate negative fitness effects of sexual coercion by enforcing their mating preferences should have a selective advantage. What behaviours females of externally fertilizing species use to reduce costs of coercion, and how effective these behaviours are, is largely unknown. We experimentally evaluated mechanisms of mate choice in a system where indiscriminate and genetically nonmatching heterospecific males coerce females into matings and females are apparently passive participants of the mating game. We performed experiments using two frog species (Rana dalmatina and R. temporaria) which are sympatric and are often observed in heterospecific matings but do not produce viable offspring. We paired R. dalmatina females with a conspecific or a heterospecific male, placed pairs together with unmated R. dalmatina males and monitored female behaviour. Females paired with heterospecific males did not try to attract the attention of conspecific males, but they delayed egg laying. Females exerted cryptic female choice by laying fewer eggs when paired with heterospecific males. Finally, some females laid a small clutch of eggs, apparently to increase the likelihood of being released by their heterospecific mate and subsequently mate with a conspecific male. Female R. dalmatina thus have subtle but effective means to avoid the complete loss of a year's reproductive effort. In a broader context, females may be able to enforce their mating preferences even in externally fertilizing species where direct female choice is overrun by male-male competition.},

abstract = {A portable data logger controlled by a Tattletale 7 microcontroller was used to record humpback whale choruses during the 1998 humpback whale winter season in Hawaii. The data logger sampled the sounds for four minutes every half hour using a digitizing rate of 2 kHz, and the data were stored on a hard disk. The results between January and April showed a peak in the sound pressure level between mid-February and mid-March. This peak of approximately 120 dB re 1 03BCPa coincided with the peak in the number of whales sighted by aerial survey on 7 March 1998. The choruses had spectral peaks at 315 Hz and 630 Hz. Some of the sounds at 630 Hz were second harmonics of the 315 Hz peak and others were not. The data also indicated a diurnal pattern in the sound pressure level, with levels at night significantly louder than the daytime levels. The sound levels began to increase during sunset and remained relatively high until sunrise, when they progressively decreased to a minimum. The nighttime peak occurred within an hour before and after midnight, and the daytime minimum occurred between 1100 and 1500. That more humpback whales appear to sing at night may reflect a switch to sexual advertisement as the primary male mating strategy at this time. It may also indicate that daylight and vision play key roles in the formation of competitive groups. It is suggested that the relative number of humpback whales in a given locale may be estimated by monitoring changes in sound pressure levels.},

abstract = {The marine aquaculture industry suffers losses due to pinniped attacks which damage net enclosures and fish stocks. Acoustic harassment devices (AHDs) emit loud sounds which are intended to deter pinnipeds from approaching aquaculture enclosures. At present, many AHDs emit sounds in the 8-20 kHz frequency range. It is not known whether sounds of higher frequencies have a deterrent effect on seals. Therefore five captive harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) were subjected to four series of tone pulses together spanning a broad frequency range (8, 16, 32 and 45 kHz). Pulse duration was 250 ms and pulse interval was 5 s. Each of the four sounds was made deterrent by increasing the amplitude. The seals reacted by swimming away from the sounds. The displacement effect of each sound was judged by comparing the animals' surface positions, and number of surfacings, during ten 45 min baseline periods with ten 45 min test periods per frequency (one frequency per day in rotation, 40 sessions in total). The seals were displaced by all four frequencies throughout the 40 trial days. The seals came to the surface more often when the test tones were produced than in the baseline periods. The initial displacement distances did not change over the 40 test days. This suggests that operating AHDs for only short periods will be more effective and less likely to result in habituation by the seals than operating them continuously. The discomfort threshold sound pressure level (SPL) was established for each of the four pulse frequencies. The acoustic discomfort threshold SPL is defined as the boundary SPL between the area that the animals generally occupied during the transmission of the sounds and the area that they generally did not enter during sound transmission. The discomfort threshold SPL may depend on the context.},

abstract = {Predators are often confronted with a broad diversity of potential prey. They rely on cues associated with prey quality and palatability to optimize their hunting success and to avoid consuming toxic prey. Here, we investigate a predator's ability to assess prey cues during capture, handling, and consumption when confronted with conflicting information about prey quality. We used advertisement calls of a preferred prey item (the t{\'{u}}ngara frog) to attract fringe-lipped bats, Trachops cirrhosus, then offered palatable, poisonous, and chemically manipulated anurans as prey. Advertisement calls elicited an attack response, but as bats approached, they used additional sensory cues in a sequential manner to update their information about prey size and palatability. While both palatable and poisonous small anurans were readily captured, large poisonous toads were approached but not contacted suggesting the use of echolocation for assessment of prey size at close range. Once prey was captured, bats used chemical cues to make final, post-capture decisions about whether to consume the prey. Bats dropped small, poisonous toads as well as palatable frogs coated in toad toxins either immediately or shortly after capture. Our study suggests that echolocation and chemical cues obtained at close range supplement information obtained from acoustic cues at long range. Updating information about prey quality minimizes the occurrence of costly errors and may be advantageous in tracking temporal and spatial fluctuations of prey and exploiting novel food sources. These findings emphasize the sequential, complex nature of prey assessment that may allow exploratory and flexible hunting behaviors.},

abstract = {Butterflyfishes are conspicuous members of coral reefs and well known for their visual displays during social interactions. Members of the genus Chaetodon have a unique peripheral arrangement of the anterior swim bladder that connects with the lateral line (the laterophysic connection) and in many species projects towards the inner ear. This morphology has lead to the proposal that the laterophysic connection and swim bladder system may be a specialized structure for the detection of sound. However, the relevant stimuli, receiver mechanisms and functions for these putative hearing structures were unknown because butterflyfishes were previously not recognized to produce sounds during natural behavior. We performed field experiments to test the hypothesis that Chaetodon produces sounds in natural social contexts. Acoustic and motor behaviors of the monogamous multiband butterflyfish, C. multicinctus, were evoked and recorded by placement of bottled fish into feeding territories of conspecific pairs. We demonstrate that territory defense includes the production of agonistic sounds and hydrodynamic stimuli that are associated with tail slap, jump, pelvic fin flick and dorsal-anal fin erection behaviors. In addition, grunt pulse trains were produced by bottled intruders and are tentatively interpreted to function as an alert call among pair mates. Acoustic behaviors include low frequency hydrodynamic pulses {\textless}100 Hz, sounds with peak energy from 100 Hz to 500 Hz, and a broadband high frequency click (peak frequency=3.6 kHz), which is produced only during the tail slap behavior. These results provide a biological framework for future studies to interpret the proximate function of the acoustico-lateralis sensory system, the evolution of the laterophysic mechanism and their relevance to butterflyfish social behavior.},

abstract = {Lunge feeding by rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) is associated with a high energetic cost that decreases diving capacity, thereby limiting access to dense prey patches at depth. Despite this cost, rorquals exhibit high rates of lipid deposition and extremely large maximum body size. To address this paradox, we integrated kinematic data from digital tags with unsteady hydrodynamic models to estimate the energy budget for lunges and foraging dives of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), the largest rorqual and living mammal. Our analysis suggests that, despite the large amount of mechanical work required to lunge feed, a large amount of prey and, therefore, energy is obtained during engulfment. Furthermore, we suggest that foraging efficiency for blue whales is significantly higher than for other marine mammals by nearly an order of magnitude, but only if lunges target extremely high densities of krill. The high predicted efficiency is attributed to the enhanced engulfment capacity, rapid filter rate and low mass-specific metabolic rate associated with large body size in blue whales. These results highlight the importance of high prey density, regardless of prey patch depth, for efficient bulk filter feeding in baleen whales and may explain some diel changes in foraging behavior in rorqual whales.},

abstract = {Two harbor porpoises in a floating pen were subjected to five pure tone underwater signals of 70 or 120 kHz with different signal durations, amplitudes and duty cycles ({\%} of time sound is produced). Some signals were continuous, others were intermittent (duty cycles varied between 8{\%} and 100{\%}). The effect of each signal was judged by comparing the animals' surfacing locations and number of surfacings (i.e. number of respirations) during test periods with those during baseline periods. In all cases, both porpoises moved away from the Sound source, but the effect of the signals on respiration rates was negligible. Pulsed 70 kHz signals with a source level (SL) of 137 dB had a similar effect as a continuous 70 kHz signal with an SL of 148 dB (re 1 mu Pa, rms). Also, a pulsed 70 kHz signal with an SL of 147 dB had a much stronger deterring effect than a continuous 70 kHz signal with a similar SL. For Pulsed 70 kHz signals (2 S Pulse duration, 4 s pulse interval, SL 147 dB re 1 mu Pa, rills), the avoidance threshold sound pressure level (SPL), in the context of the present study. was estimated to be around 130 dB (re 1 mu Pa, rms) for porpoise 064 and around 124 dB (re 1 mu Pa, rms) for porpoise 047. This study shows that ultrasonic pingers ( {\textgreater}= 70 kHz) can deter harbor porpoises. Such ultrasonic pingers have the advantage that they do not have a "dinner bell" effect on pinnipeds, and probably have no, or less, effect on other marine fauna, which are often sensitive to low frequency sounds.

abstract = {Bioacoustic probes were deployed on blue whales in and around commercial shipping lanes in Southern California. The proximity of shipping routes to predictable blue whale feeding grounds makes this an ideal location to study the impact of intense low‐frequency noise on whale behavior. The bioacoustic probe is outfitted with a calibrated hydrophone, and records temperature, pressure, and two‐axis acceleration, allowing us to evaluate sound exposure levels in relation to swimming and calling behaviors. During eight tag deployments, large commercial ships came within 1000 m or less of the tagged whale. Received levels of ship noise were measured from the tag to estimate the sound exposure levels. Because of the high level of flow noise recorded on the tag, measurements of ship noise were only possible at minimum velocity and speed. Dive and surface behaviors were evaluated related to the passage of the ship and elevated noise levels. One calling whale was tagged and exposed to ship noise at a close approach; no major change in calling behavior was observed. The results of this research provide insight on blue whale response to ships and highlight some of the challenges when measuring low frequency noise from an attached tag.

abstract = {Mate choice studies routinely assume female preferences for indicators of high quality in males but rarely consider developmental causes of within-population variation in mating preferences. By contrast, recent mate choice models assume that costs and benefits of searching or competing for high-quality males depend on females' phenotypic quality. A prediction following from these models is that manipulation of female quality should alter her choosiness or even the direction of her mating preferences. We here provide (to our knowledge) the first example where an experimental manipulation of female quality induced a mating preference for low-quality males. Zebra finches () reared in small or large experimental broods became high- or low-quality adults, respectively. Only high-quality females preferred high-quality males' mate-advertising songs, while all low-quality females preferred low-quality males' song. Subsequent breeding trials confirmed this pattern: latency until egg laying was shortest in quality-matched pairs, indicating that quality-matched birds were accepted faster as partners. Females produced larger eggs when mated with high-quality males, regardless of their own quality, indicating consensus regarding male quality despite the expression of different choices. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the development of mating preferences to understand their within-population variation and environmentally induced change.},

abstract = {Toothed whales and bats have independently evolved biosonar systems to navigate and locate and catch prey. Such active sensing allows them to operate in darkness, but with the potential cost of warning prey by the emission of intense ultrasonic signals. At least six orders of nocturnal insects have independently evolved ears sensitive to ultrasound and exhibit evasive maneuvers when exposed to bat calls. Among aquatic prey on the other hand, the ability to detect and avoid ultrasound emitting predators seems to be limited to only one subfamily of Clupeidae: the Alosinae (shad and menhaden). These differences are likely rooted in the different physical properties of air and water where cuticular mechanoreceptors have been adapted to serve as ultrasound sensitive ears, whereas ultrasound detection in water have called for sensory cells mechanically connected to highly specialized gas volumes that can oscillate at high frequencies. In addition, there are most likely differences in the risk of predation between insects and fish from echolocating predators. The selection pressure among insects for evolving ultrasound sensitive ears is high, because essentially all nocturnal predation on flying insects stems from echolocating bats. In the interaction between toothed whales and their prey the selection pressure seems weaker, because toothed whales are by no means the only marine predators placing a selection pressure on their prey to evolve specific means to detect and avoid them. Toothed whales can generate extremely intense sound pressure levels, and it has been suggested that they may use these to debilitate prey. Recent experiments, however, show that neither fish with swim bladders, nor squid are debilitated by such signals. This strongly suggests that the production of high amplitude ultrasonic clicks serve the function of improving the detection range of the toothed whale biosonar system rather than debilitation of prey.},

abstract = {Sea turtle movements often occur in open-sea unsheltered areas, and are therefore likely to be influenced by major oceanographic processes. Only recently has work started to examine the possible relationships of these movements with dynamic oceanic features, and consequently a clear picture of such interaction is only available in a few cases. Newborn sea turtles are thought to rely on oceanic currents to reach their pelagic nursery habitats. The actual extent and timing of these developmental migrations are known for only a few populations, but these movements probably last several years and range over thousands of km. Large juveniles that have been tracked during their pelagic stage were found to make long-distance movements, sometimes swimming against the prevailing currents. Older juveniles of most species leave the pelagic habitat to recruit to neritic developmental habitats. This is a very poorly documented phase of the sea turtle life-cycle, and the few available indications show that turtles may have to swim actively for enormous distances to counterbalance their previous drift with the current. The course and extent of adult postnesting migrations vary greatly among different turtle species, but two main patterns are evident. Some species, like green, hawksbill and loggerhead turtles, shuttle between the nesting beach and a specific feeding area used for the entire inter-reproductive period. In these cases, individuals swim, rather than drift, to complete their journeys, with possible advection due to currents sometimes helping them to quickly reach their target, but sometimes providing navigational challenges. Other species such as the olive ridley and the leatherback turtle, leave the coastal nesting areas to reach the pelagic environment where they forage, and perform wandering movements. Major oceanographic processes (such as main currents and eddies) have been recently shown to have a remarkable influence on leatherback movements, making it questionable whether these journeys are to be considered migrations or, rather, prolonged stays in vast feeding areas.},

abstract = {Natural selection is known to produce convergent phenotypes through mimicry or ecological adaptation. It has also been proposed that social selection--i.e., selection exerted by social competition--may drive convergent evolution in signals mediating interspecific communication, yet this idea remains controversial. Here, we use color spectrophotometry, acoustic analyses, and playback experiments to assess the hypothesis of adaptive signal convergence in two competing nonsister taxa, Hypocnemis peruviana and H. subflava (Aves: Thamnophilidae). We show that the structure of territorial songs in males overlaps in sympatry, with some evidence of convergent character displacement. Conversely, nonterritorial vocal and visual signals in males are strikingly diagnostic, in line with 6.8{\%} divergence in mtDNA sequences. The same pattern of variation applies to females. Finally, we show that songs in both sexes elicit strong territorial responses within and between species, whereas songs of a third, allopatric and more closely related species (H. striata) are structurally divergent and elicit weaker responses. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence that social selection can act across species boundaries to drive convergent or parallel evolution in taxa competing for space and resources.},

abstract = {Killer whale (Orcinus orca) audiograms were measured using behavioral responses and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) from two trained adult females. The mean auditory brainstem response (ABR) audiogram to tones between 1 and 100 kHz was 12 dB (re 1 mu Pa) less sensitive than behavioral audiograms from the same individuals (+/-8 dB). The ABR and behavioral audiogram curves had shapes that were generally consistent and had the best threshold agreement (5 dB) in the most sensitive range 18-42 kHz, and the least (22 dB) at higher frequencies 60-100 kHz. The most sensitive frequency in the mean Orcinus audiogram was 20 kHz (36 dB), a frequency lower than many other odontocetes, but one that matches peak spectral energy reported for wild killer whale echolocation clicks. A previously reported audiogram of a male Orcinus had greatest sensitivity in this range (15 kHz, similar to 35 dB). Both whales reliably responded to 100-kHz tones (95 dB), and one whale to a 120-kHz tone, a variation from an earlier reported high-frequency limit of 32 kHz for a male Orcinus. Despite smaller amplitude ABRs than smaller delphinids, the results demonstrated that ABR audiometry can provide a useful suprathreshold estimate of hearing range in toothed whales.

abstract = {Sound is increasingly being considered as a method to observe and/or control movements of fish. However, before designing acoustic methods for these tasks, it is necessary to understand how and what fish can hear, and how they respond to different types of sounds. In this paper we review the basic structure of the auditory system and describe the hearing capabilities of teleost fishes. There is considerable interspecific variation in fish ears and in the more peripheral structures associated with hearing (e.g., swim bladder) and this may have consequences for extrapolation of data between species with regard to hearing. There are also significant differences in the frequency range of sounds that may be detected by fishes and in the sensitivity to these sounds, and this certainly affects the nature of the signals that are usable in fish observation and control.},

abstract = {Increasing human activity in the ocean has lead to an increase in anthropogenic noise in the ocean. Beaked whales are deep-diving odontocetes known to feed in the tongue of the ocean, Bahamas. Recent studies show that anthropogenic noise in the sea can have significant effects on marine mammals. Of particular concern are beaked whales, which have been shown to mass strand in response to naval sonar. The detrimental link between naval sonar and marine mammals has been established in several court cases, but little is known about the effects echosounders, used in scientific research, have on marine mammals. This master‟s project investigates the effects echosounders may have on beaked whales in the tongue of the ocean, Bahamas, as well as the policy and management implications surrounding this issue. In 2008 an echosounder was deployed in the study area and the corresponding beaked whale click data was obtained from the Naval Undersea Warfare Center. The data were analyzed to determine whether a change or cessation in click activity occurred pre-, during or post echosounder deployment. The results indicated that no change was observed in click duration comparing pre-, during or post echosounder deployment. The data sets for during and post echosounder deployments were significantly smaller than pre- and could be a contributing factor to these results. These results are preliminary and further analysis into the behavioral effects of echosounders on beaked whales will be conducted. Alongside this, recent studies have shown that beaked whales respond to acoustic stimuli at much lower levels than are currently regulated for marine mammals, suggesting that there is need for a lower threshold for beaked whales in the United States than is currently being implemented.},

AIC is justified in a very general framework, and as a result, offers a crude estimator of the expected discrepancy: one which exhibits a potentially high degree of negative bias in small-sample applications (Hurvich and Tsai, 1989). AICc corrects for this bias, but is less broadly applicable than AIC since its justification depends upon the form of the candidate model (Hurvich and Tsai, 1989, 1993; Hurvich et al., 1990; Bedrick and Tsai, 1994). Although AIC and AICc share the same objective, the derivations of the criteria proceed along very different lines, making it difficult to reconcile how AICc improves upon the approximations leading to AIC. To address this issue, we present a derivation which unifies the justifications of AIC and AICc in the linear regression framework.},

Recordings were made along the Eastern Antarctic coastline at Mawson, Davis and Casey research stations. Differences in vocalizations were examined on three levels: (1) presence of unique call types/categories. (2) rate of occurrence of call types/categories, and (3) call features (number of call elements, start frequency, frequency shift, and duration). A total of 33 different call types within 13 categories were identified. Two call types were unique to Davis and one to each of Mawson and Casey. One category was unique to Davis. Significant differences in the proportion of call usage among the three stations were found for 23 of the 26 shared call types and all 11 of the shared call categories. All call features varied among stations when compared simultaneously or individually. While differences in vocalizations were observed over the mesogeographic range, some temporal variations also were observed at two of the levels; call usage and call features. Weddell seal groups separated by {\textgreater}600 km exhibited different vocal patterns.},

abstract = {Summary Vocalizations of free-ranging North Atlantic pilot whales were studied in different behavioral contexts to gain insight into the function and biological significance of different sound types. Simple whistles (with no frequency inflections) were heard more frequently when whales were “milling,” a restful behavior type. During “surface active” behavior, energetic, often coordinated activity probably representing feeding, many sound types, especially complex whistles (with more frequency inflections) and pulsed sounds, occurred with greater frequency than when this behavior was absent. Greater numbers of most whistle types were produced when whales were spread over a larger area and when more subgroups were present. Thus, in pilot whales, there is a significant relationship between their sounds and their behavior, with vocalizations possibly serving to maintain contact and coordinate movements of the herd.},

abstract = {Icelandic and Norwegian killer whales feed on herring, after debilitating them with underwater tail slaps. We analysed sound recordings of Icelandic and Norwegian killer whales engaged in feeding and other behaviour. We describe a pulsed call made by Icelandic killer whales shortly before underwater tail slaps, which had an atypical low frequency (average peak frequency: 683 ±131 Hz), long duration (3.0 ±1.1 s) and high intensity (source level 169-192 dB pp re 1 $\mu$Pa @ 1 m). The low-frequency emphasis of this call was below the most sensitive hearing range of killer whales, suggesting that the call may not be optimal for interspecific communication. However, herring could easily perceive the killer whale call since the frequency content is similar to the resonant frequency of their swim bladder as well as to the most sensitive frequency band of hearing in this species. Previous studies have shown that sound may cause schooling herring to cluster. A high density of herring in a school would increase the effectiveness of the underwater tail slaps. We suggest that some Icelandic killer whales use this low-frequency call to herd herring into dense schools immediately before delivering an underwater tail slap, thereby increasing their foraging success.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Environmental changes (a type of disturbance) are altering the habitat of southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina, an apex marine predator in the Southern Ocean. As a result, individuals may shift their behaviour, spending more time in transit and less time foraging. The effects of these sublethal changes in behaviour can accumulate, indirectly impacting lifetime fitness through changes in individual survival and reproduction. If a sufficient proportion of the population is affected, the probability of population persistence will be altered. We used data from long-term telemetry studies of female elephant seals at Macquarie Island, Australia, to model the effect of behaviour on the seals' health (i.e. all internal factors that affect homeostasis). Through simulation, we investigated the effect of increasing periods of behavioural shifts, quantifying how the exclusion of maternal southern elephant seals from foraging habitat may affect their health, offspring survival, individual fitness and population growth rate. A long period of altered behaviour ({\textgreater}50{\%} of an average foraging trip at sea) in 1 yr resulted in a small (0.4{\%}) decline in population size the following year. However, a persistent disruption (e.g. 30 yr), caused for example by the long-term effects of climate change, could result in a 0.3{\%} decline in individual fitness and a 10{\%} decline in population size. Our approach to estimating the long-term population effects of short-term changes in individual behaviour can be generalised to include physiological effects and other causes of behavioural and physiological disruption, such as anthropogenic disturbance, for any species.},

These tissues have been proposed to facilitate sound reception and are composed of unusual endogenously synthesized lipids. Little is known about how the topographical arrangement of the lipid molecules in these tissues influences sound reception. We examined the lipid composition of the mandibular fat bodies, using a fine-scale approach, on six specimens (representing four odontocete families). We show that odontocete jaw lipids exhibit a complex structural three-dimensional topography. Different odontocetes synthesize and deposit slightly different molecules, but the relative arrangement of the lipids within each head showed marked consistency. Mandibular fats of beaked whales were uniquely dominated by isolauric acid (i-12:0). In contrast, the dolphin and porpoise biosynthesized isovaleric acid (i-5:0), while the pygmy sperm whale deposited medium-length (10-14 carbons) straight-chain lipids. In all heads examined, the shortest and branched-chain ("i") fatty acids were concentrated in the center of the jaw fats, which connect intimately with the ears. We hypothesize that in odontocete jaws, this arrangement may serve to channel an incoming sound to the ears because sound travels slower through shorter branched-chain fatty acids than through longer straight-chain fatty acids},

abstract = {Acoustic signals are assumed to form the basis of manatee communication. Empirical evidence of individual vocal recognition has been reported. If manatees can recognize one another by acoustical means, it should be possible to identify individual vocal patterns. We recorded vocalizations of 14 individually housed Amazonian manatees and then digitized selected vocalizations, allowing seven variables to be measured and subjected to multivariate statistical treatment. Discriminant function analysis indicated that individuals can be separated on the basis of variables related to the fundamental frequency and signal duration. We observed significant differences in the vocal patterns between sexes and age classes. Females tended to have greater fundamental frequency and shorter note duration than males. Calves had shorter note durations and greater values for the fundamental frequency range than subadults and adults. An inverse relationship between total body length and fundamental frequency range suggests that the fundamental frequency becomes more defined as the animal ages. The similar individual patterns in the vocalizations of a mother and calf pair are discussed. Individual recognition by Amazonian manatees according to their vocal patterns is suggested through a preliminary playback experiment.},

Breath-hold durations in the laboratory (12 +/- 0.3 s, mean +/- SEM) were shorter than field observations. although a few breath-holds of over 40 s were recorded. The mean percentage time spent submerged was 89 +/- 0.4{\%}. Relative to similarly-sized terrestrial mammals, the respiratory frequency was low (4.9 +/- 0.19 breaths min(-1)) but with high tidal volumes (1.1 +/- 0.01 l), enabling a comparatively high minute rate of gas exchange. Oxygen consumption under these experimental conditions (247 +/- 13.8 ml O-2. min(-1)) was 1.9-fold higher than predicted by standard scaling relations. These data together with an estimate of the total oxygen stores predicted an aerobic dive limit of 5.4 min. The peak end-tidal O-2 values were related to the length of the previous breath-hold, demonstrating the increased oxygen uptake from the lung for the longer dives. Blood oxygen capacity was 23.5 +/- 1.0 ml.100 ml(-1), and the oxygen affinity was high, enabling rapid oxygen loading during ventilation.},

abstract = {Movement has important consequences for individual and population-level processes, but methods are only starting to become available for quantifying fine-scale movement paths of smaller animals. New techniques for inferring behavioral states and their relation to social and environmental factors provide a powerful way to test the influence of such factors on individuals. One such technique that has recently gained popularity is the use of hidden Markov models, which link time series of movement variables and the underlying behavioral states of individuals. We used hidden Markov models to evaluate behavioral states and their relation to environmental, seasonal, and social factors in the cooperatively breeding red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) while accounting for individual heterogeneity with discrete random effects. We identified 2 distinct behavioral states, resting and foraging, which were related to covariates in our models. Using this approach, we concluded that woodpecker step lengths tended to be longest in winter, larger groups of woodpeckers tended to spend less time foraging and more time resting when compared with smaller groups, and woodpeckers foraged more and rested less when in higher-quality habitat. Our results demonstrate the impact that social and environmental factors can have on movement in a social species and, thus, reinforce the importance of including these factors in animal movement studies. The extensions of basic hidden Markov models considered here may prove valuable in forthcoming studies that involve high-resolution tracking to understand behavior of birds and other small animals.},

abstract = {Propagation modeling in the ocean may be said to be a fairly mature subject, with a number of reliable and efficient acoustic models freely distributed. However, acoustic modeling to predict effects of sound on marine mammals presents some particular challenges. Standard sonar models predict the mean power levels for static receivers. However, marine-mammal researchers have shown a strong interest in being able to predict the actual time series that a moving mammal would experience as it swims through an ensonified ocean. The time series can then be used to directly model auditory models of the mammalian ear. To do this properly requires attention to subtle Doppler effects. The authors present a Gaussian-beam-tracing method that handles all these issues. Another key element needed for such models is the ability to rapidly predict three-dimensional (3-D) acoustic fields for lots of source/receiver combinations. This problem arises in trying to choose optimal locations for navy exercises, considering also a variety of hypothesized mammal-migration patterns. The authors discuss a precomputation approach to solve this problem. Finally, they examine a technique to reduce the computation needed for the one-third octave transmission loss (TL) averages. The one-third octave average is often used as a metric for the assessment of risk to mammals. The brute-force solution to this problem requires propagation modeling at many frequencies in the band. Here, the authors develop a general relationship to replace those frequency averages with much more easily computed range averages. The novelty of this approach relative to the previous range-averaging techniques is that it extends those methods to the range-dependent conditions},

abstract = {Rorqual baleen whales lunge feed by engulfment of tons of prey-laden water in a large and expandable buccal pouch. According to prior interpretations, feeding rorquals are brought to a near-halt at the end of each lunge by drag forces primarily generated by the open mouth. Accelerating the body from a standstill is energetically costly and is purported to be the key factor determining oxygen consumption in lunge-feeding rorquals, explaining the shorter dive times than expected given their sizes. Here, we use multi-sensor archival tags (DTAGs) sampling at high rates in a fine-scale kinematic study of lunge feeding to examine the sequence of events within lunges and how energy may be expended and conserved in the process of prey capture. Analysis of 479 lunges from five humpback whales reveals that the whales accelerate as they acquire prey, opening their gape in synchrony with strong fluke strokes. The high forward speed (mean depth rate: 2.0±0.32 m s(-1)) during engulfment serves both to corral active prey and to expand the ventral margin of the buccal pouch and so maximize the engulfed water volume. Deceleration begins after mouth opening when the pouch nears full expansion and momentum starts to be transferred to the engulfed water. Lunge-feeding humpback whales time fluke strokes throughout the lunge to impart momentum to the engulfed water mass and so avoid a near or complete stop, but instead continue to glide at {\~{}}1-1.5 m s(-1) after the lunge has ended. Subsequent filtration and prey handling appear to take an average of 46 s and are performed in parallel with re-positioning for the next lunge.},

abstract = {Toothed whales echolocating in the wild generate clicks with low repetition rates to locate prey but then produce rapid sequences of clicks, called buzzes, when attempting to capture prey. However, little is known about the factors that determine clicking rates or how prey type and behaviour influence echolocation-based foraging. Here we study Blainville's beaked whales foraging in deep water using a multi-sensor DTAG that records both outgoing echolocation clicks and echoes returning from mesopelagic prey. We demonstrate that the clicking rate at the beginning of buzzes is related to the distance between whale and prey, supporting the presumption that whales focus on a specific prey target during the buzz. One whale showed a bimodal relationship between target range and clicking rate producing abnormally slow buzz clicks while attempting to capture large echoic targets, probably schooling prey, with echo duration indicating a school diameter of up to 4.3 m. These targets were only found when the whale performed tight circling manoeuvres spending up to five times longer in water volumes with large targets than with small targets. The result indicates that toothed whales in the wild can adjust their echolocation behaviour and movement for capture of different prey on the basis of structural echo information.},

abstract = {Habitat distribution models are one of the most up to date methods to study the habitat usage of wildlife populations. They allow animal distribution to be related to environmental features and also the prediction of the distribution of animals based on this relationship. Seasonal aerial surveys were conducted in central Spanish Mediterranean waters from June 2000 to March 2003 to obtain information on the distribution of cetacean species. Data from the three most common cetacean species (striped dolphin, Stenella coerulcoalba, bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, and Risso's dolphin, Grampus griseus) were related, using generalized linear models, to local environmental features: depth, slope, sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration. For bottlenose dolphins, no significant relationship was found with any covariate and no dolphins were observed in waters greater than 1000 in. The distribution of both striped and Risso's dolphin was significantly related to depth. The striped dolphin showed a preference for waters between 900 and 1500 m deep and Risso's dolphin for waters more than 1500 m deep. In addition,for the latest two species, maps of distribution were predicted by means of the spatial models. The areas of higher probabilities Of occurrence coincide to a large extent with the marine protected areas previously proposed for the conservation of oceanic cetacean species.},

Occurrence and distribution of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) on the north coast of the State of Bahia, Brazil, 2000-2006. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 667-673. The Abrolhos Bank off Brazil is considered the main breeding ground for the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) in the Southwest Atlantic. However, owing to an increase in the occurrence of the species along the north coast of the State of Bahia, it has been suggested that the species is reoccupying that region, which was probably utilized by the whales before commercial whaling. Information is presented on the occurrence and distribution of humpback whales along the north coast of the State of Bahia, with a comparative overview, for the period 2000-2006. Daily research cruises were conducted from July to October, departing from Praia do Forte (13{\{}degrees{\}}40'S 38{\{}degrees{\}}10'W) and lasting [{\~{}}]9 h. Data on sampling and sighting effort, and geographical position and composition of groups of humpback whales, were collected on standardized field sheets. In all, 230 surveys were performed, covering some 9740 nautical miles in 1645 h of sampling effort, during which 1626 humpback whales were sighted, including 118 calves. Humpback whales were sighted throughout the study area. Solitary individuals and pairs were the most frequent group composition, 26{\%} and 37{\%} of the observed groups (n = 723), respectively. Depth of water varied from 15 to 1657 m (mean = 62.4; s.d. = 99). The sightings values were grouped into depth classes to ascertain the highest frequencies ([{\~{}}]30{\%}) for the two classes, i.e. between 35.1 and 55 m of water. There was an increase in the encounter rates of humpback whales on the north coast of the State of Bahia between 2000 and 2006, identifying a difference in SPUE [sightings per unit (h) of effort] among years (Kruskal-Wallis H = 30.155, d.f. = 6, p {\textless} 0.05). The results support the hypothesis that humpback whales are reoccupying former breeding areas along the Brazilian coast.},

abstract = {Balaenid whales perform long breath-hold foraging dives despite a high drag from their ram filtration of zooplankton. To maximize the volume of prey acquired in a dive with limited oxygen supplies, balaenids must either filter feed only occasionally when prey density is particularly high, or they must swim at slow speeds while filtering to reduce drag and oxygen consumption. Using digital tags with three-axis accelerometers, we studied bowhead whales feeding off West Greenland and present here, to our knowledge, the first detailed data on the kinematics and swimming behaviour of a balaenid whale filter feeding at depth. Bowhead whales employ a continuous fluking gait throughout the bottom phase of foraging dives, moving at very slow speeds (less than 1 m s(-1)), allowing them to filter feed continuously at depth. Despite the slow speeds, the large mouth aperture provides a water filtration rate of approximately 3 m(3) s(-1), amounting to some 2000 tonnes of water and prey filtered per dive. We conclude that a food niche of dense, slow-moving zooplankton prey has led balaenids to evolve locomotor and filtering systems adapted to work against a high drag at swimming speeds of less than 0.07 body length s(-1) using a continuous fluking gait very different from that of nekton-feeding, aquatic predators.},

abstract = {As a result of selective pressures faced during lactation, vocal recognition may play a crucial role in maintaining the phocid mother-pup bond during the period of dependence. To investigate this possibility, we examined whether Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) pups produce individually distinctive "primary" calls. One temporal, nine fundamental frequency features, and two spectral characteristics were measured. A discriminant function analysis (DFA) of 15 Vestfold Hills pups correctly classified 52{\%} of calls, while the cross-validation procedure classified 29{\%} of calls to the correct pup. A second DFA of 10 known-age McMurdo Sound pups correctly classified 44{\%} of "test" calls. For novel calls, the probabilities of attaining such classification rates by chance are low. The relationship between age and call stereotypy indicated that pups 2 wk and older may be more vocally distinctive. Overall, findings suggest that Weddell seal pup "primary" calls are moderately distinctive and only exhibit sufficient stereotypy to aid maternal recognition by approximately two weeks of age.},

abstract = {Bats use echolocation to exploit a variety of habitats and food types. Much research has documented how frequency-time features of echolocation calls are adapted to acoustic constraints imposed by habitat and prey but emitted sound intensities have received little attention. Bats from the family of Phyllostomidae have been categorised as low intensity (whispering) gleaners, assumed to emit echolocation calls with low source levels (approximately 70 dB SPL measured 10 cm from the bat's mouth). We used a multi-microphone array to determine intensities emitted from two phyllostomid bats from Panama with entirely different foraging strategies. Macrophyllum macrophyllum hunts insects on the wing and gaffs them with its tail membrane and feet from or above water surfaces whereas Artibeus jamaicensis picks fruit from vegetation with its mouth. Recordings were made from bats foraging on the wing in a flight room. Both species emitted surprisingly intense signals with maximum source levels of 105 dB SPL r.m.s. for M. macrophyllum and 110 dB SPL r.m.s. for A. jamaicensis, hence much louder than a `whisper'. M. macrophyllum was consistently loud (mean source level 101 dB SPL) whereas A. jamaicensis showed a much more variable output, including many faint calls and a mean source level of 96 dB SPL. Our results support increasing evidence that echolocating bats in general are much louder than previously thought. We discuss the importance of loud calls and large output flexibility for both species in an ecological context.},

abstract = {Receiving beam patterns of a harbor porpoise were measured in the horizontal plane, using narrow-band frequency modulated signals with center frequencies of 16, 64, and 100 kHz. Total signal duration was 1000 ins, including a 200 ms rise time and 300 ms fall time. The harbor porpoise was trained to participate in a psychophysical test and stationed itself horizontally in a specific direction in the center of a 16-m-diameter circle consisting of 16 equally-spaced underwater transducers. The animal's head and the transducers were in the same horizontal plane, 1.5 in below the water surface. The go/no-go response paradigm was used; the animal left the listening station when it heard a sound signal. The method of constants was applied. For each transducer the 50{\%} detection threshold amplitude was determined in 16 trials per amplitude, for each of the three frequencies. The beam patterns were not symmetrical with respect to the midline of the animal's body, but had a deflection of 3-7 degrees to the right. The receiving beam pattern narrowed with increasing frequency. Assuming that the pattern is rotation-symmetrical according to an average of the horizontal beam pattern halves, the receiving directivity indices are 4.3 at 16,kHz, 6.0 at 64 kHz, and 11.7 dB at 100 kHz. The receiving directivity indices of the porpoise were lower than those measured for bottlenose dolphins. This means that harbor porpoises have wider receiving beam patterns than bottlenose dolphins for the same frequencies. Directivity of hearing improves, the signal-to-noise ratio and thus is a tool for a better detection of certain signals in a given ambient noise condition. (C) 2005 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {To prevent grounding of ships and collisions between ships in shallow coastal waters, an underwater data collection and communication network is currently under development: Acoustic Communication network for Monitoring of underwater Environment in coastal areas (ACME). Marine mammals might be affected by ACME sounds since they use sounds of similar frequencies (around 12 kHz) for communication, orientation, and prey location. If marine mammals tend to avoid the vicinity of the transmitters, they may be kept away from ecologically important areas by ACME sounds. One marine mammal species that may be affected in the North Sea is the harbour porpoise. Therefore, as part of an environmental impact assessment program, two captive harbour porpoises were subjected to four sounds, three of which may be used in the underwater acoustic data communication network. The effect of each sound was judged by comparing the animals' positions and respiration rates during a test period with those during a baseline period. Each of the four sounds could be made a deterrent by increasing the amplitude of the sound. The porpoises reacted by swimming away from the sounds and by slightly, but significantly, increasing their respiration rate. From the sound pressure level distribution in the pen, and the distribution of the animals during test sessions, discomfort sound level thresholds were determined for each sound. In combination with information on sound propagation in the areas where the communication system may be deployed, the extent of the 'discomfort zone' can be estimated for several source levels (SLs). The discomfort zone is defined as the area around a sound source that harbour porpoises are expected to avoid. Based on these results, SLs can be selected that have an acceptable effect on harbour porpoises in particular areas. The discomfort zone of a communication sound depends on the selected sound, the selected SL, and the propagation characteristics of the area in which the sound system is operational. In shallow, winding coastal water courses, with sandbanks, etc., the type of habitat in which the ACME sounds will be produced, propagation loss cannot be accurately estimated by using a simple propagation model, but should be measured on site. The SL of the communication system should be adapted to each area (taking into account bounding conditions created by narrow channels, sound propagation variability due to environmental factors, and the importance of an area to the affected species). The discomfort zone should not prevent harbour porpoises from spending sufficient time in ecologically important areas (for instance feeding areas), or routes towards these areas.

abstract = {The past decade has seen a wealth of new data on the auditory capabilities and mechanisms of fishes. We now have a significantly better appreciation of the structure and function of the auditory system in fishes with regard to their peripheral and central anatomy, physiology, behaviour, sound source localization and hearing capabilities. This paper deals with two of the newest of these findings, hair cell heterogeneity and the detection of ultrasound. As a result of this recent work, we now know that fishes have several different types of sensory hair cells in both the ear and lateral line and there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that these hair cell types arose very early in the evolution of the octavolateralis system. There is also some evidence to suggest that the differences in the hair cell types have functional implications for the way the ear and lateral line of fishes detect and process stimuli. Behavioural studies have shown that, whereas most fishes can only detect sound to 1-3 kHz, several species of the genus Alosa (Clupeiformes, i.e. herrings and their relatives) can detect sounds up to 180 kHz (or even higher). It is suggested that this capability evolved so that these fishes can detect one of their major predators, echolocating dolphins. The mechanism for ultrasound detection remains obscure, though it is hypothesized that the highly derived utricle of the inner ear in these species is involved.},

abstract = {The annual abundance population estimates of the endangered beluga whales in Cook Inlet (CI), Alaska, have indicated a decline in the population over the past decades and no convincing explanation has been offered so far for this trend. Satellite tracking data of about 20 Cook Inlet beluga whales (CIBW) over some 5-year period, as well as annual population counts and stranding reports were compared with environmental observations. The seasonal movements of the belugas within CI appear to be affected by variations in water temperature, ice coverage and most significantly, by river discharge. Statistically significant correlations were found between the seasonal movements of the CIBW and the timing of peak flows at different rivers. Interannual variations of the CIBW movements were found to relate to year-to-year variations in water temperature and the time of ice melt/freezing; thus, in warmer years the CIBW will stay in the upper inlet longer, before dispersing to the mid and lower CI in winter. Both, the population of the beluga and stranding numbers show a 3–4-year cycle of interannual variations resembling the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index, though the exact mechanism in which large-scale climate variations impact the CIBW habitat is not clear yet. The analysis suggests that the method of estimating the CIBW population from annual aerial surveys needs further evaluation, since interannual changes in the spatial distribution of CIBW preferred locations may have a confounding effect on estimates of population abundance.},

@article{Helfrich2003,
abstract = {Field observations imply that accumulation and advection of invertebrate larvae and other plankton by propagating fronts provides an efficient mechanism for the cross-shelf transport and subsequent coastal settlement of larvae and plankton. Gravity currents propagating into a heavier, uniform-density fluid are known to have near-surface velocities u that exceed the propagation speed c of the gravity current nose. It is shown by simple dam-break laboratory experiments and through corresponding numerical solutions of two-dimensional stratified flow and Lagrangian particle advection that this characteristic of gravity currents can lead to accumulation in the gravity current nose of particles that originate well behind the gravity current head. However, efficient particle accumulation and transport with the speed c only occurs for particles with sufficient vertical buoyancy or vertical swimming capability. Weakly buoyant or neutral particles are swept down and back away from the gravity current head by the circulation in this region. A dam break into an ambient fluid with stratification (two-layered) could result in the transport of some particles that are initially trapped in the forepart of the leading disturbance, an undular bore. However, this situation does not result in significant accumulation of particles at the leading edge of the disturbance. The numerical solutions show that particles that originate in the dense fluid ahead of the gravity current are much less likely to be accumulated at the gravity current nose. A simple scaling criterion for the minimum vertical buoyancy velocity for efficient accumulation and transport of buoyant particles based on the gravity current and particle characteristics is developed and compares favorably with the numerical results. The implications of these results for transport of larvae in coastal environments are discussed.},

@article{May-Collado2007a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:It is widely held that in toothed whales, high frequency tonal sounds called 'whistles' evolved in association with 'sociality' because in delphinids they are used in a social context. Recently, whistles were hypothesized to be an evolutionary innovation of social dolphins (the 'dolphin hypothesis'). However, both 'whistles' and 'sociality' are broad concepts each representing a conglomerate of characters. Many non-delphinids, whether solitary or social, produce tonal sounds that share most of the acoustic characteristics of delphinid whistles. Furthermore, hypotheses of character correlation are best tested in a phylogenetic context, which has hitherto not been done. Here we summarize data from over 300 studies on cetacean tonal sounds and social structure and phylogenetically test existing hypotheses on their co-evolution.RESULTS:Whistles are 'complex' tonal sounds of toothed whales that demark a more inclusive clade than the social dolphins. Whistles are also used by some riverine species that live in simple societies, and have been lost twice within the social delphinoids, all observations that are inconsistent with the dolphin hypothesis as stated. However, cetacean tonal sounds and sociality are intertwined: (1) increased tonal sound modulation significantly correlates with group size and social structure; (2) changes in tonal sound complexity are significantly concentrated on social branches. Also, duration and minimum frequency correlate as do group size and mean minimum frequency.CONCLUSION:Studying the evolutionary correlation of broad concepts, rather than that of their component characters, is fraught with difficulty, while limits of available data restrict the detail in which component character correlations can be analyzed in this case. Our results support the hypothesis that sociality influences the evolution of tonal sound complexity. The level of social and whistle complexity are correlated, suggesting that complex tonal sounds play an important role in social communication. Minimum frequency is higher in species with large groups, and correlates negatively with duration, which may reflect the increased distances over which non-social species communicate. Our findings are generally stable across a range of alternative phylogenies. Our study points to key species where future studies would be particularly valuable for enriching our understanding of the interplay of acoustic communication and sociality.},

@article{Lammers2003,
abstract = {Dolphins produce frequency modulated (FM) whistles that are thought to promote the synchrony and coordination of behavior between members of a group. How whistles are used in this regard remains poorly understood. One possibility is that whistles have directionality and thereby convey the orientation and direction of movement of the signaler to nearby listeners. To explore this possibility, whistles from free-ranging Hawaiian spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) were obtained using a towed, three-hydrophone line array and examined for the presence of directionality. Both the estimated source level and harmonic content of whistles produced by animals traveling with or toward the array were greater than those of animals moving ahead or away from it. In addition, signals produced by animals near the array (within 20 m) were received differently on the three hydrophones spaced 11.5 m apart. These differences were greater than would be expected from transmission loss disparities alone. The results indicate that directivity is present in the transmission pattern of whistles. To infer the form of this directivity, a theoretical whistle beam pattern was established based on the assumption that the dolphin's sound source is approximated by a circular piston transducer (Au 1993). The resulting beam indicates that spinner dolphin whistles become increasingly directional with frequency, especially with respect to harmonics. The orientation-dependent harmonic structure of whistles thus presents a potential cue that listening animals could interpret to infer the direction of movement of signalers. Harmonics are present in the whistles of many dolphin species and may represent an inherent signal design feature that promotes coordination between animals.},

abstract = {Fishes can regenerate lateral line and inner ear sensory hair cells that have been lost following exposure to ototoxic antibiotics. However, regenerative capabilities following noise exposure have not been explored in fish. Moreover, nothing is known about the functional relationship between hair cell damage and hearing loss, or the time course of morphological versus functional recovery in fishes. This study examines the relationship between hair cell damage and physiological changes in auditory responses following noise exposure in the goldfish (Carassius auratus). Goldfish were exposed to white noise (170 dB re. 1 muPa RMS) for 48 h and monitored for 8 days after exposure. Auditory thresholds were determined using the auditory evoked potential technique, and morphological hair cell damage was analyzed using phalloidin and DAPI labeling to visualize hair cell bundles and nuclei. A TUNEL assay was used to identify apoptotic cells. Following noise exposure, goldfish exhibited a significant temporary threshold shift (TTS; ranging from 13 to 20 dB) at all frequencies tested (from 0.2-2 kHz). By 7 days post-exposure, goldfish hearing recovered significantly (mean TTS{\textless}4 dB). Increased apoptotic activity was observed in the saccules and lagenae between 0 and 2 days post-exposure. Immediately after noise exposure, the central and caudal regions of saccules exhibited significant loss of hair bundles. Hair bundle density in the central saccule recovered by the end of the experiment (8 days post-exposure) while bundle density in the caudal saccule did not return to control levels in this time frame. These data demonstrate that goldfish inner ear epithelia show damage following noise exposure and that they are capable of significant regenerative responses similar to those seen following ototoxic drug treatment. Interestingly, functional recovery preceded morphological recovery in the goldfish saccule, suggesting that only a subset of hair cells are necessary for normal auditory responses, at least to the extent that hearing was measured in this study.},

abstract = {Animals in many vertebrate species vocalize in response to predators, but it is often unclear whether these antipredator calls function to communicate with predators, conspecifics or both. We evaluated the function of antipredator calls in 10 species of passerines by measuring the acoustic directionality of these calls in response to experimental presentations of a model predator. Acoustic directionality quantifies the radiation pattern of vocalizations and may provide evidence about the receiver of these calls. We predicted that antipredator calls would have a lower directionality if they function to communicate with surrounding conspecifics, and a higher directionality and aimed at the receiver if they function to communicate with the predator. Our results support both of these functions. Overall, the birds produce antipredator calls that have a relatively low directionality, suggesting that the calls radiate in many directions to alert conspecifics. However, birds in some species increase the directionality of their calls when facing the predator. They can even direct their calls towards the predator when facing lateral to it{\^{a}}€”effectively vocalizing sideways towards the predator. These results suggest that antipredator calls in some species are used to communicate both to conspecifics and to predators, and that birds adjust the directionality of their calls with remarkable sophistication according to the context in which they are used.},

abstract = {We studied the echolocation and hunting behavior of three aerial insectivorous species of bats (Vespertilionidae: Pipistrellus) in the field in order to characterize the signals used by the bats and to determine how call structure varies in relation to habitat structure (''uncluttered'' versus ''cluttered'' space). We documented free-flying, naturally foraging wild pipistrelles in various habitats using multiflash stereophotography combined with simultaneous sound recordings. Then we reconstructed the bat's flight position in three-dimensional space and correlated it with the corresponding echolocation sequences. In all three species of pipistrelles, signal structure varied substantially. In echolocation sequences of the search phase we found a consistent association of signal types with habitat types. In uncluttered habitats (obstacles more than 5 m from the bat) pipistrelles emitted almost exclusively narrowband signals with bandwidths less than 15 kHz. In cluttered habitats (obstacles less than 5 m from the bat) they switched to signals with bandwidths of more than 15 kHz. Wideband signals were also used when the bats were turning in cluttered and uncluttered spaces and for an instant after turning away from obstacles. Prey detection occured only when the outgoing signal did not overlap with the returning echo from potential prey. The bats also avoided overlap of echoes from potential prey and obstacles. Based on the results of this study, we propose an overlap-free ''window'' within which pipistrelles may detect potential prey and which allows predictions of minimum distances to prey and clutter-producing objects.},

abstract = {Theories of music evolution agree that human music has an affective influence on listeners. Tests of non-humans provided little evidence of preferences for human music. However, prosodic features of speech ({\^{a}}€˜motherese{\^{a}}€™) influence affective behaviour of non-verbal infants as well as domestic animals, suggesting that features of music can influence the behaviour of non-human species. We incorporated acoustical characteristics of tamarin affiliation vocalizations and tamarin threat vocalizations into corresponding pieces of music. We compared music composed for tamarins with that composed for humans. Tamarins were generally indifferent to playbacks of human music, but responded with increased arousal to tamarin threat vocalization based music, and with decreased activity and increased calm behaviour to tamarin affective vocalization based music. Affective components in human music may have evolutionary origins in the structure of calls of non-human animals. In addition, animal signals may have evolved to manage the behaviour of listeners by influencing their affective state.},

abstract = {It has recently been proposed that life-history evolution is subject to a fundamental size-dependent constraint. This constraint limits the rate at which biomass can be produced so that production per unit of body mass is inevitably slower in larger organisms than in smaller ones. Here we derive predictions for how changes in body size and production rates evolve in different lifestyles subject to this constraint. Predictions are tested by using data on the mass of neonate tissue produced per adult per year in 637 placental mammal species and are generally supported. Compared with terrestrial insectivores with generalized primitive traits, mammals that have evolved more specialized lifestyles have divergent mass-specific production rates: (i) increased in groups that specialize on abundant and reliable foods: grazing and browsing herbivores (artiodactyls, lagomorphs, perissodactyls, and folivorous rodents) and flesh-eating marine mammals (pinnipeds, cetaceans); and (ii) decreased in groups that have lifestyles with reduced death rates: bats, primates, arboreal, fossorial, and desert rodents, bears, elephants, and rhinos. Convergent evolution of groups with similar lifestyles is common, so patterns of productivity across mammalian taxa reflect both ecology and phylogeny. The overall result is that groups with different lifestyles have parallel but offset relationships between production rate and body size. These results shed light on the evolution of the fast-slow life-history continuum, suggesting that variation occurs along two axes corresponding to body size and lifestyle.},

abstract = {We examined the effects of kin-biased territorial defense behavior on the distribution of foraging attempts and percent weight changes (fitness benefits) in juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in an artificial stream channel. The individual percent weight changes and frequency of aggressive interactions and foraging attempts were quantified in kin (full sibling) and non-kin groups of salmon and trout. We observed kin groups of both species to obtain significantly greater mean and less variable percent weight gains that non-kin groups. In addition, faster-growing (dominant) individuals of both species within kin groups exhibited significantly fewer aggressive interactions than did faster-growing nonkin individuals, while we observed no difference between kin and non-kin slower-growing (subordinate) individuals. Slower-growing kin individuals of both species obtained significantly more foraging opportunities than slower-growing non-kin individuals while there was no difference between faster-growing kin and non-kin individuals. These data suggest that reduced aggression by faster-growing individuals towards slower-growing kin enables slower-growing kin to obtain more foraging opportunities, resulting in higher and less variable percent weight changes. These data also suggest that as a result of kin-biased territorial defense and foraging behavior, juvenile Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout may be able to maximize inclusive fitness potential by defending territories near related conspecifics.},

abstract = {Much of the published research on the auditory ability of sea turtles centers on anatomy, and from these anatomical studies, we hypothesize that the loggerhead sea turtle's (Caretta caretta) hearing range centers around low-frequency sounds. To vali- date this hypothesis, we examined thresholds of juvenile loggerheads by collecting auditory evoked potentials derived from two types of vibrational stimuli: low-frequen- cy clicks and tone bursts. The broadband click elicited clear auditory brainstem re- sponses (ABRs) that could be tracked to threshold; a mean click threshold for 35 juvenile loggerheads was -10.8 dB re: Ig rms ? 2.3 dB SD. ABR recordings from the low frequency tone bursts were similar in form to the click data and indicated the range of effective hearing to be from at least 250 Hz to 750 Hz. The most sensitive threshold was recorded at the lowest frequency tested, 250 Hz, with a mean threshold of -26.3 dB re: Ig rms ? 2.3 dB SD. Historically, ABRs have been used as a technique to evaluate audition and acoustic threshold, and we feel confident that the procedures developed here are both valid and effective when used on sea turtles.},

abstract = {Controlled feeding experiments were undertaken with captive Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) to assess seasonal (winter vs. summer) physiological responses of individual animals to reduced quantities and qualities of food that are hypothesised to occur in the wild. Eight animals were randomly divided into two experimental groups fed isocaloric diets: Group H ate Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) throughout the experiment while Group P was switched to walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) during a 28-day food restriction (after a 28-day baseline) and back to herring during a 28-day controlled re-feeding. Diet type did not impact the rates of body mass lost when food was restricted, but did influence the type of internal energy reserve (protein vs. lipids) the sea lions predominantly used. In both summer and winter, Group H lost significantly more lipids and less lean mass than Group P that was fed pollock during the restriction phase. The response of Group H was consistent with the predicted pattern of nutritional stress physiology (i.e. protein sparing and utilization of lipid reserves). Group P lost a surprisingly high proportion of body protein while consuming restricted levels of pollock, which could lead to muscle impairment and vital organ failure on a long-term basis. When given increased amounts of herring during the controlled re-feeding phase, the capacity of both groups to compensate for the previous mass loss was found to depend on season and was independent of previous diet. All of the sea lions increased their rates of mass gain and returned to their pre-experimental weight during winter, but not during summer. Some intrinsic energetic plasticity related to seasonal adaptation to the environment may render winter an easier period than summer to recover from nutritional stress.},

abstract = {One hypothesis for the function of vocal repertoires in songbirds is that singing multiple song types facilitates song matching, a behaviour in which one male replies to a rival's song with a song of the same type. In eastern populations of song sparrows, low levels of whole song sharing restrict opportunities for matching of entire song types. A male in this population might still match a neighbour by replying with a partially shared song (i.e. a song that contains one or more phrases in common with the neighbour's song). We tested for partial matching in a Pennsylvania population using playback of three categories of song: self song (allowing a full match), stranger song (a control allowing no match) and hybrid self/stranger song (allowing a partial match). We also tested the hypothesis that matching is a directed signal of aggressive intentions by comparing subjects' approach distances between trials in which they did and did not match. Males in our study matched in response to both self song (21 of 39 trials) and hybrid song (23 of 40 trials) at levels significantly greater than expected based on control trials (5 of 40 trials). Males that performed a partial match to a hybrid song approached the speaker more closely than males that did not match, consistent with the hypothesis that partial matching is a directed signal of aggression. Self song matching did not predict approach as successfully.},

abstract = {The social cohesion hypothesis of play asserts that the adaptive function of social play is to strengthen affiliative ties between group members, thereby increasing cohesion within the social group. Although this hypothesis is frequently cited, it has never been quantitatively tested. I used data collected from a wild population of cooperative mongoose (the meerkat, Suricata suricatta) to test four predictions arising from the hypothesis: first, that an individual's frequency of play, and mean number of play partners, will be positively correlated with group size (because individuals in large groups must strengthen ties with a greater number of animals); second, an individual's frequency of play will be positively related to frequency of other affiliative interactions such as allogrooming; third, an individual's frequency of play will be positively correlated with level of contribution to cooperative group activities (based on the assumption that individuals that are closely bonded to their group will invest more heavily in the group than those with weak ties); and finally, an individual's frequency of play will be positively correlated with duration of tenancy in the natal group. The behaviour of young meerkats failed to fulfil any of these predictions, and I conclude that social play is unlikely to have the capacity to promote social cohesion in mammals.

abstract = {1.A preparation has been developed for the study of central auditory neurophysiology in cetaceans. Under N2O and Fluothane anesthesia, supplemented by succinylcholine chloride, twenty-nine specimens of four species of dolphins, most commonly Stenella caeruleo-alba, were stimulated with air-borne sound, water-borne sound, and directly by hydrophone pressed against the skin of the head. Evoked potential responses were recorded chiefly from the inferior colliculi but also from medullary auditory centers and the medial geniculate.2.The recorded potentials were onset responses of complicated waveform, usually having components with latencies of 2–4 msec. The longer latency responses probably represent heterogenous input to the inferior colliculi and, in a few cases, activity of collicular cells or input to the medial geniculate body. Shorter latency responses probably represent output of the cochlear nuclei and activity of medullary auditory nuclei.3.Although the evoked responses do not reflect increases in stimulus duration beyond a fraction of 1 msec, response threshold and waveform are sensitive to changes in rise time between 0.1 and 1.0 msec, and the small duration necessary to provide the onset response (as little as 0.1 msec) is also sufficient to provide accurate information about the frequency of the stimulus.4.Evoked potential responses in certain locations and intensity ranges were found to change markedly in amplitude or waveform with intensity changes as small as 1 db. The same response in other intensity ranges might be little altered by intensity changes as large as 10 db.5.Measurements of sensitivity as a function of frequency varied with electrode location, but averages or determinations of maximum sensitivity at each frequency at any location in a given animal produced audiograms in close agreement with that obtained behaviorally in Tursiops truncatus by Johnson (1966). Sensitivity was maximum at about 60 kc/s, and high between 20 and 70 kc/s; it typically fell about 25 db between 20 and 10 kc/s, and the same amount between 60 and 100 kc/s. The highest frequency eliciting a response was 120–140 kc/s. Data from the four species were not noticeably different.6.Response waveform and amplitude were often changed much more dramatically than was threshold by small changes in stimulus frequency, emphasizing the heterogeneity of input to a given electrode location, and the sharpness of frequency discrimination. Changes in threshold of up to 3 db/percent change in frequency were seen. Actual frequency discrimination is undoubtedly much sharper than these evoked potential measurements would indicate.7.The masking effect of background tones was shown to be confined to a relatively narrow band of frequencies surrounding that of the stimulus. Changes in masking effectiveness reached 30 db/10 kc/s change in background tone frequency. This too provides a conservative estimate of response “tuning”, since the evoked potentials represent the summed activity of such a large population of different units.8.Frequency modulated (FM) pulses of 2–5 msec duration and gradual rise and fall times were found sometimes to produce unexpectedly large responses compared with the response to any constant frequency (CF) pulse within the swept range. The response waveforms differed sharply with changes in starting frequency or range swept, even when the maximum response amplitude remained unchanged. In certain cases an FM pulse was found to be up to 10 db more effective if swept upward than if swept downward, and vice versa. It seems probable that significant populations of cells exist that are specifically responsive to sounds having certain FM characteristics, or certain combinations of frequencies in a given temporal order.9.Temporal resolution of successive sounds by cetaceans was found to be extremely rapid; virtually complete recovery of responsiveness in the fastest case took 0.8–1.0 msec between clicks; some initial recovery was often visible at approximately 0.5 msec. Following of a train of click stimuli was seen a repetition rates up to 2,000/sec. However, more typical recordings showed complete recovery of the collicular evoked potential required 3–5 msec. There was no evidence of facilitation of response to the second of two identical stimuli, as has been observed in echolocating bats.10.Distortion of the sound field by holding a sheet of paper between the source and the lower jaw or melon can in some recording sites cause dramatic changes in response waveform without significantly affecting the maximum response amplitude.11.The primary pathway of sound to the cochlea is via the lower jaw. When stimuli were applied either with a loudspeaker in air, a hydrophone pressed against various points on the head, or a hydrophone underwater, sensitivity was consistently greatest over a limited portion of the side of the contralateral lower jaw, nearly as high over the ipsilateral side of the melon, markedly lower over the side of the head including the external ear orifice, and almost nil at the rostrum. This map was confirmed by using a distant sound source and local acoustical shields of 10×12 cm pieces of foam rubber or paper; held over the sensitive part of the lower jaw or melon this caused marked attenuation of response. At low frequencies (30 kc/s) the same pattern was found, but sensitivity was somewhat more uniform, relatively greater over the side of the head including the external auditory meatus and reduced on the melon, compared with the high-frequency pattern (60 kc/s).12.Gentle stroking of the side of the jaw or splashing of water on the jaw masked response to sounds. The effective input is acoustic. The effective area is circumscribed and identical to that for sound. Electrical stimulation of the skin of the jaw elicited no response in auditory centers and did not mask responses to sounds.13.A cone of best reception is directed forward and downward, some 5-30° from the midline in the horizontal plane (the higher the frequency the closer to the midline), and 5–20° below the horizontal in the optimum vertical plane. Sensitivity fell sharply (up to 1.5 db/degree) at more lateral angles. Sound coming from above the horizontal is probably much reduced in effectiveness.14.None of the response parameters studied was found to be affected by the anesthetics used, or by anesthetic doses of Nembutal.15.The evoked response characteristics are evaluated from the standpoint of adaptations for echolocation, and compared with analagous responses in bats and non-echolocating mammals. Possible mechanisms of distance measurement are considered. Target localization is discussed in light of the patterns of angular sensitivity resulting from use of the lower jaws as primary pathways of sound to the ears. The question is raised: In view of the extreme sensitivity of the head surface to mechanical disturbance, especially around the lower jaw, is echolocation usable during natural activity, e.g. rapid swimming, pursuit of prey, or food mastication ? If so, what adaptations have occurred to help overcome the potential masking noise ?},

abstract = {Duty cycle describes the relative 'on time' of a periodic signal. In bats, we argue that high duty cycle (HDC) echolocation was selected for and evolved from low duty cycle (LDC) echolocation because increasing call duty cycle enhanced the ability of echolocating bats to detect, lock onto and track fluttering insects. Most echolocators (most bats and all birds and odontocete cetaceans) use LDC echolocation, separating pulse and echo in time to avoid forward masking. They emit short duration, broadband, downward frequency modulated (FM) signals separated by relatively long periods of silence. In contrast, bats using HDC echolocation emit long duration, narrowband calls dominated by a single constant frequency (CF) separated by relatively short periods of silence. HDC bats separate pulse and echo in frequency by exploiting information contained in Doppler-shifted echoes arising from their movements relative to background objects and their prey. HDC echolocators are particularly sensitive to amplitude and frequency glints generated by the wings of fluttering insects. We hypothesize that narrowband/CF calls produced at high duty cycle, and combined with neurobiological specializations for processing Doppler-shifted echoes, were essential to the evolution of HDC echolocation because they allowed bats to detect, lock onto and track fluttering targets. This advantage was especially important in habitats with dense vegetation that produce overlapping, time-smeared echoes (i.e. background acoustic clutter). We make four specific, testable predictions arising from this hypothesis.},

abstract = {When experiencing resource competition or abrupt environmental change, animals often must transition rapidly from an ancestral diet to a novel, derived diet. Yet, little is known about the proximate mechanisms that mediate such rapid evolutionary transitions. Here, we investigated the role of diet-induced, cryptic genetic variation in facilitating the evolution of novel resource-use traits that are associated with a new feeding strategy{\^{a}}€”carnivory{\^{a}}€”in tadpoles of spadefoot toads (genus Spea). We specifically asked whether such variation in trophic morphology and fitness is present in Scaphiopus couchii, a species that serves as a proxy for ancestral Spea. We also asked whether corticosterone, a vertebrate hormone produced in response to environmental signals, mediates the expression of this variation. Specifically, we compared broad-sense heritabilities of tadpoles fed different diets or treated with exogenous corticosterone, and found that novel diets can expose cryptic genetic variation to selection, and that diet-induced hormones may play a role in revealing this variation. Our results therefore suggest that cryptic genetic variation may have enabled the evolutionary transition to carnivory in Spea tadpoles, and that such variation might generally facilitate rapid evolutionary transitions to novel diets.},

We compared observed variation in synchronized swimming at two research sites in relation to disturbance exposure to test these two hypotheses. This study describes and quantifies pair synchronization in long-finned pilot whales at the Strait of Gibraltar, Spain and Cape Breton, Canada. Synchronization differed depending on the behavioral state and the response is different in the two sites leading to the conclusion that environment can shape the occurrence and magnitude of certain behaviors. We also analyzed intra-population variations in synchronization among 4 social units of Pilot whales in the Strait of Gibraltar and the results of this study confirmed the affiliative role of synchronization and highlighted an influence of disturbance on synchronization. We can conclude that synchronization is a common behavior in long-finned pilot whales that allow for close proximity and rapid coordinated response of individuals, with the multiple functions of showing affiliation and reacting to disturbance.},

abstract = {Assessments of the impact of offshore energy developments are constrained because it is not known whether fine-scale behavioural responses to noise lead to broader-scale displacement of protected small cetaceans. We used passive acoustic monitoring and digital aerial surveys to study changes in the occurrence of harbour porpoises across a 2000 km2 study area during a commercial two-dimensional seismic survey in the North Sea. Acoustic and visual data provided evidence of group responses to airgun noise from the 470 cu inch array over ranges of 5-10 km, at received peak-to-peak sound pressure levels of 165-172 dB re 1 {\{}micro{\}}Pa and sound exposure levels (SELs) of 145-151 dB re 1 {\{}micro{\}}Pa2 s-1. However, animals were typically detected again at affected sites within a few hours, and the level of response declined through the 10 day survey. Overall, acoustic detections decreased significantly during the survey period in the impact area compared with a control area, but this effect was small in relation to natural variation. These results demonstrate that prolonged seismic survey noise did not lead to broader-scale displacement into suboptimal or higher-risk habitats, and suggest that impact assessments should focus on sublethal effects resulting from changes in foraging performance of animals within affected sites.},

Such data, from northern elephant seals instrumented with time–temperature–depth recorders (TTDR) and ARGOS platform terminal transmitters, is examined in this study. Northern elephant seals range widely over the northeastern Pacific on long foraging trips. The seals dive continuously on these trips to depths of 400–600 m. Between March 1998 and March 1999, six female and three male elephant seals were tagged in central California and data were collected during subsequent foraging trips. Temperature and depth were measured and stored every 30 s and retrieved after the animals returned to the r...},

FFT contours (window size 512, hanning, sampling frequency 44.1 kHz) were extracted with a custom developed Matlab software: 277 samples of striped dolphins (northwestern basin), 158 of Risso's dolphin and 120 of common dolphins were selected. Fifteen variables were extracted from the contours, including: duration, frequency range, number of frequency extrema, beginning, ending, maximal and minimal frequencies, initial, final, maximal and minimal frequency slopes, presence of harmonics. All three species were significantly different (Mann-Whitney test) for average durations (respectively 0.72, 0.65 and 0.47 sec.), frequency ranges (respectively 7296, 6365 and 4622 Hz) and max frequencies. Initial and final slopes were significant to discriminate common dolphins from the two other species. Beginning and minimal frequencies were significantly different for striped dolphins and other species. A discriminant analysis was carried out and showed that two species could be discriminated with a good confidence level (chi(2) test, alpha = 0.05).},

abstract = {Whales show an exceptionally wide range of diving capabilities and many express high amounts of the O(2) carrier protein myoglobin (Mb) in their muscle tissues that prolongs their aerobic diving capacity. Although previous studies have mainly focused on the muscle Mb concentration and O(2) carrying capacity as markers of diving behavior in whales, it still remains unexplored whether whale Mbs differ in their O(2) affinities and in their enzymatic activities as nitrite reductase and peroxidase enzymes, all functions that could contribute to differences in diving capacities. In this study, we have measured the functional properties of purified Mbs from five toothed whales and two baleen whales and have examined their correlation with the average dive duration. Results showed that some variation in functional properties exists among whale Mbs with the toothed whale Mbs having higher O(2) affinities and nitrite reductase activities (similar to those of horse) compared with baleen whale Mbs. However, these differences did not correlate with average dive duration. Instead, a significant correlation was found between whale Mb concentration and average duration and depth of dives and between O(2) affinity and nitrite reductase activity when including other mammalian Mbs. Despite the fact that the functional properties showed little species-specific differences in vitro, they may still contribute to enhancing diving capacity as a result of the increased muscle Mb concentration found in extreme divers. In conclusion, Mb concentration rather than specific functional reactivities may support whale diving performance.},

abstract = {The foraging and echolocation behaviour of three European pipistrelles (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. nathusii and P. kuhlii) was studied under natural conditions. The pipistrelles were photographed with two 35 mm cameras under stroboscopic illumination, and their echolocation signals were recorded simultaneously. This permits a three-dimensional reconstruction of the flight paths of bat and prey, and allows the details of echolocation behaviour to be studied in the context of natural foraging behaviour. The general relationships between foraging and echolocation behaviour were consistent among the three species. Foraging behaviour consisted of four stages: search flight (before detection of prey), approach flight (pursuit after detection of prey), capture and retrieval of prey. These stages correlated with phases in echolocation behaviour: search, approach, and terminal phase followed by a pause. Detection of prey occurred at distances of 1.14-2.20 m. The search cone extending from the bat's mouth was up to 150 degrees wide. The pipistrelles caught prey in mid-air, either with the tail membrane alone or by funnelling it with a wing onto the tail membrane. Except for some intra- and interspecific differences in sound duration, pulse interval, bandwidth and terminal frequency in search phase, the structure and pattern of the echolocation signals were similar in the three pipistrelles. In the approach and terminal phases, pulse duration and pulse interval decreased with the approach to the target, while bandwidth and sweeprate increased. While pursuing insects, the pipistrelles precisely avoided an overlap between outgoing signal and the echo returning from the prey. Furthermore, the bats stopped emitting signals several centimetres before they reached the insect. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract = {Abstract: In contrast to historical assumptions about the affective nature of animal vocalizations, it is now clear that many vertebrates are capable of producing specific alarm calls in response to different predators, calls that provide information that goes beyond the motivational state of a caller. However, although these calls function referentially, it does not mean that they are devoid of motivational content. Studies on meerkats (Suricata suricatta) directly support this conclusion. The acoustic structure of their alarm calls simultaneously encodes information that is both motivational (level of urgency) and referential (predator specific). In this study, we investigated whether alarm calls of young meerkats undergo developmental modification and whether the motivational or the referential aspect of calls changes more over time. We found that, based on their acoustic structure, calls of young showed a high correct assignment to low- and high-urgency contexts but, in contrast to adults, low assignment to specific predator types. However, the discrimination among predator types was better in high-urgency than in low-urgency contexts. Our results suggest that acoustic features related to level of urgency are expressed earlier than those related to predator-specific information and may support the idea that referential calls evolve from motivational signals.},

By considering plots of the univariate and multidimensional distributions, we are able to examine the fit of both the assumed marginal distribution and the correlation structure of the observed data. We provide general conditions for the convergence of the empirical distribution to the true distribution, and demonstrate that these conditions hold for a wide variety of time-series models. Thus, our method allows us to compare not only the fit of different HMMs, but also that of other models as well. We illustrate our technique using a multiple sclerosis data set.},

abstract = {Juveniles of the common seal, Phoca vitulina, have two kinds of aquatic play: (1) Dyadic play, in which muzzle-to-body and body contact between two animals is combined with exuberant somersaulting movements. The somersaulting behaviour is usually preceded by a contact phase with very little movement. A play bout may end with a period of sustained, almost static contact. (2) Group play, which resembles the normal social haul-out activities, but each activity is repeated several times in a playful manner. Although several animals may be leaping and splashing simultaneously, each animal temporarily orients his play towards one other, whom it may contact briefly. All play by juveniles of the grey seal, Halichoerus grypus, is preceded by each animal of the dyad giving a stereotyped invitation signal, which must be repeated continually by both animals throughout play: each animal in turn lays its head over its partner's back. For the initial phase of play which takes place on the beach, the two animals lie beside one another, each lunging gently at the other's head, in between head-over-back signals. Adolescents may occasionally rear up and lunge at each other in a manner similar to the fighting of adult males. After playing on the beach, the pair may enter the water, where their play is similar to the dyadic play of the common seal. The aquatic somersaulting over one another by two animals in continuous body contact seems to be a pattern not found in these two species in other functional contexts. Common seal group play serves to (i) integrate the individuals into a unified group, and (ii) acquaint individuals. Although grey seals apparently do not have group play, behaviour which is probably functionally analogous was observed, in which the seals became acquainted over a 3-week period in early autumn before any play occurred. /// Les jeunes du Phoque Phoca vitulina se servent pour leur jeu dans l'eau de deux sortes d'activit{\~{A}}{\textcopyright}: (1) Jeu {\~{A}}  deux, c'est {\~{A}}  dire o{\~{A}}¹ deux animaux se touchent l'un {\~{A}}  l'autre, museau au corps, gambadant vigoureusement en faisant des culbutes l'un sur l'autre.

abstract = {The social-learning function of a food call is to share information about resources with conspecifics. Field studies on the social learning of food and parent-offspring interactions regarding food in a natural environment are rare. Our aims in a 2-year study in the Rocky Mountain National Park, U.S.A., were to monitor white-tailed ptarmigan, Lagopus leucurus, hens' food calls, a vocalizing and tidbitting display, to determine whether the hens selected foraging areas based on food availability and whether chicks learned about important food resources from hen food calls. Our findings indicate that the white-tailed ptarmigan hen's food call is a form of cultural transmission in which information regarding available food is disseminated from hens to chicks. Hens chose foraging patches where certain plant species were abundant and called their chicks to these foods, which dominated their diet. Chick consumption mirrored the calling rates of hens and as a result chicks ate high-protein foods, which are critical for chick growth and development. The results suggest that white-tailed ptarmigan hens' food calls may function to enhance survival of juvenile ptarmigan.},

abstract = {Juvenile and adult sea turtles often navigate to specific feeding areas during long-distance migrations, and adults periodically return to particular geographic areas for mating and nesting. In addition, turtles displaced from feeding or nesting areas often home to the site of capture. Relatively little is known, however, about how turtles navigate to particular goal areas. Both juvenile and adult turtles use the Earth's magnetic field as a source of navigational information. Laboratory experiments have provided evidence that juvenile green turtles learn the magnetic topography of their feeding grounds and acquire a “magnetic map” that facilitates navigation toward particular locations. Adult green turtles displaced from nesting beaches on an island in the Indian Ocean showed diminished homing ability when magnets were attached to their heads, implying that mature turtles also exploit magnetic cues when navigating to islands or other specific destinations. Although geomagnetic information appears to be an important component of sea turtle navigation, it is unlikely to be the only cue used. Additional experiments in which nesting green turtles were displaced from islands have highlighted the possible involvement of local, non-magnetic cues in the final phase of island-finding. Thus, a reasonable hypothesis is that turtles use multiple cues to navigate in the marine environment, perhaps relying on a magnetic map to navigate into the vicinity of a distant target and then using non-magnetic cues to guide themselves to the final goal.},

abstract = {Increased encephalization, or larger brain volume relative to body mass, is a repeated theme in vertebrate evolution. Here we present an extensive sampling of relative brain sizes in fossil and extant taxa in the mammalian order Carnivora (cats, dogs, bears, weasels, and their relatives). By using Akaike Information Criterion model selection and endocranial volume and body mass data for 289 species (including 125 fossil taxa), we document clade-specific evolutionary transformations in encephalization allometries. These evolutionary transformations include multiple independent encephalization increases and decreases in addition to a remarkably static basal Carnivora allometry that characterizes much of the suborder Feliformia and some taxa in the suborder Caniformia across much of their evolutionary history, emphasizing that complex processes shaped the modern distribution of encephalization across Carnivora. This analysis also permits critical evaluation of the social brain hypothesis (SBH), which predicts a close association between sociality and increased encephalization. Previous analyses based on living species alone appeared to support the SBH with respect to Carnivora, but those results are entirely dependent on data from modern Canidae (dogs). Incorporation of fossil data further reveals that no association exists between sociality and encephalization across Carnivora and that support for sociality as a causal agent of encephalization increase disappears for this clade.},

Attempts at classifying uncertainty in ecology have, for the most part, focused exclusively on epistemic uncertainty. In this paper we classify uncertainty into two main categories: epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty in determinate facts) and linguistic uncertainty (uncertainty in language). We provide a classification of sources of uncertainty under the two main categories and demonstrate how each impacts on applications in ecology and conservation biology. In particular, we demonstrate the importance of recognizing the effect of linguistic uncertainty, in addition to epistemic uncertainty, in ecological applications. The significance to ecology and conservation biology of developing a clear understanding of the various types of uncertainty, how they arise and how they might best be dealt with is highlighted.

abstract = {Abstract   Snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) produce a fast, well-focused water jet by rapid closure of their specialised snapper claw. As shown previously, water jets may injure the opponent in interspecific encounters (e.g. with small crabs) although no damage was observed in intraspecific encounters. For conspecific receivers the jet represents a potential hydrodynamic signal and can be analysed with the help of mechanosensory hairs. To gain more insight in the biophysical characteristics of the water jet we visualised and analysed jets of tethered snapping shrimp using standard and high speed video recordings. Water jet width increases with increasing distance from the snapper claw tip, and both width and distance increase with increasing snapper claw size. Water jet distances do not increase with increasing claw cocking duration (building up muscle tension) but medium cocking durations of about 550 ms result in longest distances. Mean water jet velocity is 6.5 m s−1 shortly after claw closure but rapidly decreases subsequently. At the mean distance between snapping conspecifics (9 mm) water jet velocities produced by snapping shrimp with larger snapper claws are significantly higher than those of animals with smaller claws. Interestingly, males with equal snapper claw size as females produce significantly faster water jets.},

abstract = {A broadband sonar system and digital camera with strobe lights were mounted on a vertically profiling frame with a depth sensor. The echo strengths and densities of animals within individual mesopelagic boundary community patches were investigated as a function of depth. Time and distance from shore were also investigated. Simultaneous surface echosounder surveys permitted comparison of density estimates from two techniques. Echo strength values suggest nearshore boundary community animals are primarily myctophid fishes, which was confirmed by preliminary photographic evidence. Echo strength varied significantly as a function of distance from the shoreline and time. These measures of echo strength are important for estimating density from a surface echosounder. Density estimates from these revised echo strengths compare well with those made with echo highlight counting, which is independent of echo strength. These density measures suggest that previous density estimates were too low but do not change the conclusions of these studies. Vertical microstructure in density was apparent but animal size and compositional structure was not evident within a patch. Patch edges were abrupt, with no differences in the density or echo strength from patch interiors. These edges were generally straight, with a sharp drop in density to the background density of zero. Estimates of animal size as a function of time provide information about the diel migration patterns of these mesopelagic animals. (C) 2003 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of the echolocating bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to sonar echoes at different time delays after sonar emissions was measured in a two-choice echo detection experiment. Since echo delay is perceptually equivalent to target range, the experiment effectively measured sensitivity to targets at different ranges. The bat's threshold for detecting sonar echoes at a short delay of only 1.0 msec after emissions (corresponding to a range of 17 cm) was 36 dB SPL (peak to peak), but the threshold decreased to 8 dB SPL at a longer delay of 6.4 msec (a range of 1.1 m). Prior research has shown that, at even longer delays (corresponding to ranges of 3 to 5 m), the bat's threshold is in the region of 0 dB SPL. Contractions of the bat's middle ear muscles synchronized with the production of echolocation sounds cause a transient loss in hearing sensitivity which appears to account for the observed echo detection threshold shifts. The bat's echo detection thresholds increase by approximately 11 dB for each reduction in target range by a factor of 2 over the span from 17 cm to 1.1 m. As range shortens, the amplitude of echoes from small targets also increases, by 12 dB for each 2-fold reduction in range. Thus, when approaching a target, the bat compensates for changes in echo strength as target range shortens by changing its hearing threshold. Since this compensation appears to occur in the middle ear, the bat regulates echoes reaching the cochlea to a stable amplitude during its approach to a target such as a flying insect. In addition to this automatic gain control linked to target range, the bat aims its head to track a target's position during approach, thus stabilizing echo amplitude even if the target's direction changes. We hypothesize that the bat's directional emissions, directional hearing, middle ear muscle contractions, and head aim response collectively create a three-dimensional spatial tracking filter which the bat locks onto targets to stabilize echo amplitudes during interception of prey. We further hypothesize that this regulation, which cancels echo amplitude changes caused by the target's changing spatial position, leaves the bat free to observe echo amplitude changes caused by the target's own actions, such as insect wing beats. Elimination of spatially dependent echo amplitude changes removes the cause of potentially troublesome changes in neural response latency and keeps stimulation from echoes in the "tip" region of auditory nerve fiber tuning curves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Protected areas are often proposed as tools for conserving endangered populations of marine megafauna. Our study area includes a voluntary no-entry reserve embedded within wider critical habitat for Threatened [`]northern resident' killer whales under Canada's Species at Risk Act. Our study quantified the reserve's importance to whales by assessing habitat preference in a behavioural context, and population-level implications of that preference given threats from human activities, such as oil spills resulting from shipping traffic. We recorded summertime activities of whales from 1995 to 2002. Whales were observed on 397 of 530 (74.9{\%}) days. Whales showed strong preference for the reserve over adjacent waters, and used it preferentially for feeding and beach-rubbing. While the area comprises {\~{}}0.001{\%} of the whales' range, an overall average of 6.5{\%} of the population was present each day. Frequently, {\textgreater}50{\%} of this small population was aggregated in the restricted and heavily trafficked waterway of Johnstone Strait. Using the Potential Biological Removal equation, we calculated potential annual mortality limits (ML) of 2.2 animals. Mean group size in the area exceeded ML on 55.8{\%} of days overall, and 98.8{\%} of days when conditioning on whale presence. The whales' high reliance on a trivial fraction of their range means that opportunities are routine for one stochastic, catastrophic event to cause population decline. On 20 August 2007, a barge loaded with {\~{}}10,000 L of diesel sank in the area, exposing 25{\%} of the population. This underscores the importance of identifying critical habitat for threatened populations, and ensuring meaningful protection.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic noise has fundamentally changed the acoustics of terrestrial and aquatic environments, and there is growing empirical evidence that even a single noise exposure can affect behaviour in a variety of vertebrate organisms. Here, we use controlled experiments to investigate how the physiology of a marine invertebrate, the shore crab (Carcinus maenas), is affected by both single and repeated exposure to ship-noise playback. Crabs experiencing ship-noise playback consumed more oxygen, indicating a higher metabolic rate and potentially greater stress, than those exposed to ambient-noise playback. The response to single ship-noise playback was size-dependent, with heavier crabs showing a stronger response than lighter individuals. Repeated exposure to ambient-noise playback led to increased oxygen consumption (probably due to handling stress), whereas repeated exposure to ship-noise playback produced no change in physiological response; explanations include the possibility that crabs exhibited a maximal response on first exposure to ship-noise playback, or that they habituated or become tolerant to it. These results highlight that invertebrates, like vertebrates, may also be susceptible to the detrimental impacts of anthropogenic noise and demonstrate the tractability for more detailed investigations into the effects of this pervasive global pollutant.},

abstract = {Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are one of several baleen whale species in the Northwest Atlantic that coexist with vessel traffic and anthropogenic noise. Passive acoustic monitoring strategies can be used in conservation management, but the first step toward understanding the acoustic behavior of a species is a good description of its acoustic repertoire. Digital acoustic tags (DTAGs) were placed on humpback whales in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary to record and describe the non-song sounds being produced in conjunction with foraging activities. Peak frequencies of sounds were generally less than 1 kHz, but ranged as high as 6 kHz, and sounds were generally less than 1 s in duration. Cluster analysis distilled the dataset into eight groups of sounds with similar acoustic properties. The two most stereotyped and distinctive types ("wops" and "grunts") were also identified aurally as candidates for use in passive acoustic monitoring. This identification of two of the most common sound types will be useful for moving forward conservation efforts on this Northwest Atlantic feeding ground.},

abstract = {Animals produce a tremendous diversity of sounds for communication to perform life's basic functions, from courtship and parental care to defence and foraging. Explaining this diversity in sound production is important for understanding the ecology, evolution and behaviour of species. Here, we present a theory of acoustic communication that shows that much of the heterogeneity in animal vocal signals can be explained based on the energetic constraints of sound production. The models presented here yield quantitative predictions on key features of acoustic signals, including the frequency, power and duration of signals. Predictions are supported with data from nearly 500 diverse species (e.g. insects, fishes, reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals). These results indicate that, for all species, acoustic communication is primarily controlled by individual metabolism such that call features vary predictably with body size and temperature. These results also provide insights regarding the common energetic and neuromuscular constraints on sound production, and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of producing these sounds.},

abstract = {Noise can interfere with acoustic communication by masking signals that contain biologically important information. Communication theory recognizes several ways a sender can modify its acoustic signal to compensate for noise, including increasing the source level of a signal, its repetition, its duration, shifting frequency outside that of the noise band, or shifting the timing of signal emission outside of noise periods. The extent to which animals would be expected to use these compensation mechanisms depends on the benefit of successful communication, risk of failure, and the cost of compensation. Here we study whether a coastal marine mammal, the manatee, can modify vocalizations as a function of behavioral context and ambient noise level. To investigate whether and how manatees modify their vocalizations, natural vocalization usage and structure were examined in terms of vocalization rate, duration, frequency, and source level. Vocalizations were classified into two call types, chirps and squeaks, which were analyzed independently. In conditions of elevated noise levels, call rates decreased during feeding and social behaviors, and the duration of each call type was differently influenced by the presence of calves. These results suggest that ambient noise levels do have a detectable effect on manatee communication and that manatees modify their vocalizations as a function of noise in specific behavioral contexts.},

The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

Here we characterize vocalizations of the Amazon River dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), for which whistles have been reported but not well documented. We studied Inia at the Mamirau{\'{a}} Sustainable Development Reserve in central Brazilian Amaz{\^{o}}nia. During 480 5-min blocks (over 5 weeks) we monitored and recorded vocalizations, noted group size and activity, and tallied frequencies of breathing and pre-diving surfaces. Overall, Inia vocal output correlated positively with pre-diving surfaces, suggesting that vocalizations are associated with feeding. Acoustic analyses revealed Inia vocalizations to be structurally distinct from typical delphinid whistles, including those of the delphinid Sotalia fluviatilis recorded at our field site. These data support the hypothesis that whistles are a recently derived vocalization unique to the Delphinidae.},

abstract = {Juvenile loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) from West Atlantic nesting beaches occupy oceanic (pelagic) habitats in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, whereas larger juvenile turtles occupy shallow (neritic) habitats along the continental coastline of North America. Hence the switch from oceanic to neritic stage can involve a trans-oceanic migration. Several researchers have suggested that at the end of the oceanic phase, juveniles are homing to feeding habitats in the vicinity of their natal rookery. To test the hypothesis of juvenile homing behaviour, we surveyed 10 juvenile feeding zones across the eastern USA with mitochondrial DNA control region sequences (N = 1437) and compared these samples to potential source (nesting) populations in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea (N = 465). The results indicated a shallow, but significant, population structure of neritic juveniles (03A6ST = 0.0088, P = 0.016), and haplotype frequency differences were significantly correlated between coastal feeding populations and adjacent nesting populations (Mantel test R2 = 0.52, P = 0.001). Mixed stock analyses (using a Bayesian algorithm) indicated that juveniles occurred at elevated frequency in the vicinity of their natal rookery. Hence, all lines of evidence supported the hypothesis of juvenile homing in loggerhead turtles. While not as precise as the homing of breeding adults, this behaviour nonetheless places juvenile turtles in the vicinity of their natal nesting colonies. Some of the coastal hazards that affect declining nesting populations may also affect the next generation of turtles feeding in nearby habitats.},

abstract = {Many animals produce vocal sequences that appear complex. Most researchers assume that these sequences are well characterized as Markov chains (i.e. that the probability of a particular vocal element can be calculated from the history of only a finite number of preceding elements). However, this assumption has never been explicitly tested. Furthermore, it is unclear how language could evolve in a single step from a Markovian origin, as is frequently assumed, as no intermediate forms have been found between animal communication and human language. Here, we assess whether animal taxa produce vocal sequences that are better described by Markov chains, or by non-Markovian dynamics such as the 'renewal process' (RP), characterized by a strong tendency to repeat elements. We examined vocal sequences of seven taxa: Bengalese finches Lonchura striata domestica, Carolina chickadees Poecile carolinensis, free-tailed bats Tadarida brasiliensis, rock hyraxes Procavia capensis, pilot whales Globicephala macrorhynchus, killer whales Orcinus orca and orangutans Pongo spp. The vocal systems of most of these species are more consistent with a non-Markovian RP than with the Markovian models traditionally assumed. Our data suggest that non-Markovian vocal sequences may be more common than Markov sequences, which must be taken into account when evaluating alternative hypotheses for the evolution of signalling complexity, and perhaps human language origins.},

abstract = {The calling seasonality of blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and fin (B. physalus) whales was assessed using acoustic data recorded on seven autonomous acoustic recording packages (ARPs) deployed from March 2001 to February 2003 in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Automatic detection and acoustic power analysis methods were used for determining presence and absence of whale calls. Blue whale calls were detected year round, on average 177 days per year, with peak calling in March and April, and a secondary peak in October and November. Lowest calling rates occurred between June and September, and in December. Fin whale calling rates were seasonal with calls detected between February and June (on average 51 days/year), and peak calling in May. Sea ice formed a month later and retreated a month earlier in 2001 than in 2002 over all recording sites. During the entire deployment period, detected calls of both species of whales showed negative correlation with sea ice concentrations at all sites, suggesting an absence of blue and fin whales in areas covered with sea ice. A conservative density estimate of calling whales from the acoustic data yields 0.43 calling blue whales per 1000 n mi2 and 1.30 calling fin whales per 1000 n mi2, which is about one-third higher than the density of blue whales and approximately equal to the density of fin whales estimated from the visual surveys.},

abstract = {Vocalizations of Belding's ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi) were recorded during the summer of 1982 near Tioga Pass in the central Sierra Nevada of California. Sonagrams were made and call parameters were measured. Discriminant function analyses revealed that multiple-note calls ([`]trills') differed acoustically depending on whether they occurred in response to a predator, or were given by males following copulations. The post-copulatory trills of males were individually distinctive. Among anti-predator trills there was no evidence of predator-specificity within the narrow range of predators tested: trills given to two species of (stuffed) weasels (Mustela), to dogs and to humans were statistically indistinguishable. Sonagrams of trills occurring in agonistic contexts suggest that a third general category of trills may exist, but agonistic trills were more variable than either anti-predator or post-copulatory trills. The ground squirrels also gave single-note calls in the three contexts described above, either repetitively ([`]chirps') or singly ([`]whistles'). Neither chirps nor whistles encoded any obvious situation-specific information, except that whistles were typically associated with rapidly-moving predators, usually raptors. The post-copulatory chirps of males were individually distinctive. Vocalizations of Belding's ground squirrels may not vary among contexts as much as do the analogous calls of California ground squirrels (S. beecheyi).},

Researchers distinguish between a number of different social-learning mechanisms such as imitation and social enhancement. Social enhancement is a simple form of social learning that is among the most widespread in animals. However, unlike imitation, it is debated whether social enhancement can create cultural traditions. Based on a recent study on capuchin monkeys, we developed an agent-based model to test the hypotheses that (i) social enhancement can create and maintain stable traditions and (ii) social enhancement can create cultural conformity. Our results supported both hypotheses. A key factor that led to the creation of cultural conformity and traditions was the repeated interaction of individual reinforcement and social enhancement learning. This result emphasizes that the emergence of cultural conformity does not necessarily require cognitively complex mechanisms such as {\^{a}}€˜copying the majority{\^{a}}€™ or group norms. In addition, we observed that social enhancement can create learning dynamics similar to a {\^{a}}€˜copy when uncertain{\^{a}}€™ learning strategy. Results from additional analyses also point to situations that should favour the evolution of learning mechanisms more sophisticated than social enhancement.},

abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.

Therefore, the target strength of 11 types of bottom-set gillnets was measured under 0 and 45 degrees angles of incidence. From these target strengths and from knowledge on the echolocation abilities of two odontocete species (harbour porpoises, bottlenose dolphins), the detection ranges of the nets by these small cetaceans could be estimated. The 90{\%} detection range by echolocating harbour porpoises, approaching the nets at right (perpendicular) angles under low noise level conditions, varied between 3 and 6 m depending on the net type. For bottlenose dolphins, under high noise conditions, the 90{\%} detection range varied between 25 and 55 m. At other angles of approach, the estimated detection ranges are shorter. The study suggests that echolocating bottlenose dolphins can detect nets in time to avoid collision, whereas echolocating harbour porpoises cannot in;most cases. Suggestions for future research to reduce small cetacean bycatch by improving the nets' detectability by echolocation are given. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The diving reaction of Sardinella aurita under a survey vessel seems rather limited in comparison to herring schools. It is only perceptible in the first 20 m and its mean amplitude is about 5 m. This amplitude is inversely proportional to the initial school depth. Such a limited amplitude allows one to estimate that the fish tilt angle is less than 10" when the school is overpassed. Therefore, the underestimation of density due to vertical avoidance is probably low. This estimation of tilt angle was made under the assumption that the lateral avoidance just under the boat was negligible: the propeller noise in front of a vessel is attenuated by the hull and the resulting funnel-shaped acoustic shadow should be responsible for the limited lateral avoidance reaction observed when the fish previously located on the vessel route are overpassed.},

abstract = {Animals using sound communication have developed different strategies to overcome noise interference, but studies have rarely examined animals behaving in their natural environments. Males of the leptodactylid frog Eupsophus calcaratus exposed to natural noises of wind, rain, creek and sea surf and to a band-pass noise encompassing the main spectral components of the conspecific advertisement call increased their call rate in the presence of noises of moderate level, and this effect was particularly strong for the band-pass noise. Frogs exposed to band-pass noise of different intensities increased their call rate in response to exposures of 66-78 dB RMS sound pressure level. Call duration followed similar trends, but the effects of noise exposure on this measure of evoked vocal response were not as strong as those on call rate. The vocal responsiveness of males of this species in the presence of noise denotes adaptations to cope with high interference, in spite of the relatively simple acoustic environment of the austral temperate forest.

@article{Cardona2005,
abstract = {An aerial survey was conducted in early spring 2002 over the continental shelf of the Balearic Archipelago to study the distribution of neritic loggerhead turtles. Furthermore, five juvenile loggerhead turtles [straight carapace length (SCL) range 37.1–48.7 cm], were instrumented with transmitters and monitored during 2003 by satellite tracking to study habitat use over a broader geographical range. The distribution of the turtles over the continental shelf matched habitat availability, as defined by depth. However, those tracked by satellite spent most of the time in the oceanic waters of the Algerian basin and generally avoided continental shelf areas. In these turtles, average speed of travel and mean cosine of turning angle did not significantly differ between habitats, indicating that avoidance of shelf areas is not due to active habitat selection. On average, tracked turtles spent 35.1±19.7{\%} of the time at the surface, although surface time was much greater in the turtle with the shortest carapace length, suggesting that this individual had limited swimming capacity. We conclude that the transition between passive drifting and active habitat selection occurs at an SCL of about 40 cm. The turtles followed tracks that matched prevailing currents, but on some occasions they also swam upstream. Hence, the distribution of late juvenile loggerhead turtles in the southern and central western Mediterranean may reflect a combination of passive drifting and active habitat selection.},

Observations were made both during surveying and during pelagic trawling. Horizontal swimming speed was length-dependent, but there were great variations between schools, even those with fish of similar size. The schools were usually guided in front of the approaching vessel, but often the schools avoided the path of the vessel. Vessel avoidance increased during pelagic trawling. By taking advantage of the guiding effect, and modifying the gear rigging, the capture success of the pelagic sampling trawl was increased. An attempt is made to quantify the influence of vessel-avoidance and upper blind-zone distribution on the total abundance estimate.},

Each trial consisted of two to eight dives separated by surface intervals that were determined by the sea lion (spontaneous trials) or by the researcher (conditioned trials). During conditioned trials, surface intervals were long enough for O(2) to return to pre-dive levels between each dive. The metabolic cost of each dive event (dive+surface interval; DMR) was measured using flow-through respirometry. The respiratory exchange ratio (V(O(2))/V(CO(2))) was significantly lower during spontaneous trials compared with conditioned trials. DMR was significantly higher during spontaneous trials and decreased exponentially with dive duration. A similar decrease in DMR was not as evident during conditioned trials. DMR could not be accurately estimated from the surface interval (SI) following individual dives that had short SIs ({\textless}50 s), but could be estimated on a dive by dive basis for longer SIs ({\textgreater}50 s). DMR decreased by 15{\%}, but did not differ significantly from surface metabolic rates (MR(S)) when dive duration increased from 1 to 7 min. Overall, these data suggest that DMR is almost the same as MR(S), and that Steller sea lions incur an O(2) debt during spontaneous diving that is not repaid until the end of the dive bout. This has important consequences in differentiating between the actual and ;apparent' metabolic rate during diving, and may explain some of the differences in metabolic rates reported in pinniped species.},

@article{Slater2010,
abstract = {Modern whales are frequently described as an adaptive radiation spurred by either the evolution of various key innovations (such as baleen or echolocation) or ecological opportunity following the demise of archaic whales. Recent analyses of diversification rate shifts on molecular phylogenies raise doubts about this interpretation since they find no evidence of increased speciation rates during the early evolution of modern taxa. However, one of the central predictions of ecological adaptive radiation is rapid phenotypic diversification, and the tempo of phenotypic evolution has yet to be quantified in cetaceans. Using a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of extant cetaceans and a morphological dataset on size, we find evidence that cetacean lineages partitioned size niches early in the evolutionary history of neocetes and that changes in cetacean size are consistent with shifts in dietary strategy. We conclude that the signature of adaptive radiations may be retained within morphological traits even after equilibrium diversity has been reached and high extinction or fluctuations in net diversification have erased any signature of an early burst of diversification in the structure of the phylogeny.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic noise impacts marine mammals in a variety of ways. In order to estimate over which ranges this happens, we first need to understand the propagation of noise through the ocean away from the noise source, and, second, understand the relationship between received noise levels and impact thresholds. A software package combining both aspects is presented. (1) A sound propagation model based on ray theory was developed to calculate received noise levels as a function of range, depth, and frequency. (2) Current knowledge of noise impact thresholds for marine mammals was gathered and included in software routines predicting zones of impact on marine mammals around industrial underwater noise sources. As input parameters, this software package requires the source level and spectrum of the noise of interest; physical oceanography data about the local ocean environment such as bathymetry, bottom and surface loss data, and sound speed profiles; and bioacoustical information about the target species in the form of an audiogram, critical auditory bandwidths, spectra of typical animal vocalizations, reported sound levels of disturbance, and criteria for hearing damage. As output, the software produces data files and plots of the zones of audibility, masking, disturbance, and potential hearing damage around a noise source.},

abstract = {The sea snake Lapemis curtus is a piscivorous predator that hunts at dusk. Like land snakes, sea snakes have scale sensillae that may be mechanoreceptive, i.e. that may be useful for the detection of water motions produced by prey fish. In addition, inner ear hair cells of sea snakes may also be involved in the detection of hydrodynamic stimuli. We generated water motions and pressure fluctuations with a vibrating sphere. In the test range 50-200 Hz evoked potentials were recorded from the midbrain of L. curtus in response to vibrating sphere stimuli. In terms of water displacement the lowest threshold amplitudes were in the frequency range 100-150 Hz. In this range peak-to-peak water displacement amplitudes of 1.8 [mu]m (at 100 Hz) and 2.0 [mu]m (150 Hz) generated a neural response in the most sensitive animal. Although this low sensitivity may be sufficient for the detection of fish-generated water motions, it makes it unlikely that L. curtus has a special hydrodynamic sense.},

abstract = {Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) echolocation clicks have not been widely recorded. Concurrent with visual observations, acoustic recordings of free-ranging Dall's porpoise were made offshore of southern California using a towed hydrophone array with two elements of 250 kHz bandwidth. We examined 6035 clicks from 12 sessions totaling more than two hours over the course of seven days. The Dall's porpoise echolocations recorded were short (48–804 µs), narrow band (2–10 kHz [−3dB]) clicks with most peak frequencies between 117 and 141 kHz, but some as high as 198 kHz. Many clicks contained a multipulse temporal structure, resulting in stereotyped spectral peaks and notches. Two distinctive click types with different spectral banding patterns and peak frequencies (122.8 and 135.8 kHz) were observed. Spectral banding patterns have been used as a species identifier for Risso's dolphins and Pacific white-sided dolphins. These two dolphins and Dall's porpoise have similar head morphologies, which may play a role in producing clicks with spectral peaks and notches. This study shows that Dall's porpoise produce multiple click types, which may provide a tool for population classification, and that their clicks contain spectral banding patterns, which may provide insight into the mechanism by which such clicks are produced.},

Larvae were caught in light traps and then placed in a submerged binary choice chamber with an artificial source of reef sound {\~{}}80 m from one end of the chamber. At night, larvae moved towards the sound source; during the day, larvae showed no preference. These results suggest that pomacentrid larvae can detect reef sound and are capable of directional hearing.

abstract = {The acoustic channel is important for communication in otariids ( fur seals and sea lions). Discrimination between species, sex or individuals is essential in communication; therefore insight into the role of vocalisations in recognition is vital to understanding otariid social interactions. We measured vocalisations and their use in discriminating sex and species in male Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea). Barking calls of mature males were recorded and analysed based on five acoustic parameters. A discriminant function analysis classified calls to the correct individual at a classification rate of 56{\%}, suggesting that male barking calls are individually distinctive with the potential to facilitate individual vocal recognition. Playback experiments were used to assess the role of vocalisations in sex and species recognition both in and out of the breeding season. Males showed significantly stronger reactions to both conspecific and heterospecific males than they did to conspecific females and were most responsive during the breeding season. Australian sea lion males have the most depauperate vocal repertoire of any otariid. This simple repertoire may reflect the ecological circumstances in which these animals breed, with very low colony densities, asynchronous breeding and low levels of polygyny. Yet even in this simple system, males are able to discriminate between males and females of their own species, and distinguish the calls of conspecifics from other species. The barking calls of male Australian sea lions have sufficient information embedded to provide the potential for individual discrimination and this ability will be assessed in future studies.},

abstract = {The two equilibrium receptor organs (statocysts) of Nautilus are avoid sacks, half-filled with numerous small, free-moving statoconia and half with endolymph. The inner surface of each statocyst is lined with 130,000-150,000 primary sensory hair cells. The hair cells are of two morphological types. Type A hair cells carry 10-15 kinocilia arranged in a single ciliary row; they are present in the ventral half of the statocyst. Type B hair cells carry 8-10 irregularly arranged kinocilia; they are present in the dorsal half of the statocyst. Both type of hair cells are morphologically polarized. To test whether these features allow the Nautilus statocyst to sense angular accelerations, behavioural experiments were performed to measure statocyst-dependent funnel movements during sinusoidal oscillations of restrained Nautilus around a vertical body axis. Such dynamic rotatory stimulation caused horizontal phase-locked movements of the funnel. The funnel movements were either in the same direction (compensatory funnel response), or in the opposite direction (funnel follow response) to that of the applied rotation. Compensatory funnel movements were also seen during optokinetic stimulation (with a black and white stripe pattern) and during stimulations in which optokinetic and statocyst stimulations were combined. These morphological and behavioural findings show that the statocysts of Nautilus, in addition to their function as gravity receptor organs, are able to detect rotatory movements (angular accelerations) without the specialized receptor systems (crista/cupula systems) that are found in the statocysts of coleoid cephalopods. The findings further indicate that both statocyst and visual inputs control compensatory funnel movements.},

It is found that both the spectral contents of the calls and the inner-ear sensitivity change in a similar fashion along an altitudinal gradient. As a result, the call frequencies and the auditory tuning are closely matched at all altitudes. We suggest that the animal's body size determines the frequency particulars of the call apparatus and the inner ear.},

Changes in climate are likely to bring about profound changes to the environment in which these animals live and subsequently to the hunting practices and livelihoods of the people who hunt them. Climate change will lead to reduction in the sea ice extent and thickness and will likely increase shipping through the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage and oil and gas activities in Arctic areas previously inaccessible. Such activities will lead to more frequent interactions between humans and marine mammals. These activities may also change the distribution of marine mammals, affecting the hunters. This paper...},

abstract = {Field recordings of echolocation signals produced by Heaviside's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii) were made off the coast of South Africa using a hydrophone array system. The system consisted of three hydrophones and an A-tag (miniature stereo acoustic data-logger). The mean centroid frequency was 125 kHz, with a -3 dB bandwidth of 15 kHz and -10 dB duration of 74 $\mu$s. The mean back-calculated apparent source level was 173 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa(p.-p.). These characteristics are very similar to those found in other Cephalorhynchus species, and such narrow-band high-frequency echolocation clicks appear to be a defining characteristic of the Cephalorhynchus genus. Click bursts with very short inter-click intervals (up to 2 ms) were also recorded, which produced the "cry" sound reported in other Cephalorhynchus species. Since inter-click intervals correlated positively to click duration and negatively to bandwidth, Heaviside's dolphins may adjust their click duration and bandwidth based on detection range. The bimodal distribution of the peak frequency and stable bimodal peaks in spectra of individual click suggest a slight asymmetry in the click production mechanism.},

Broadband clicks were highly variable in duration, with a frequency range of 6 to {\textgreater}22 Id-It. Bark vocalisations consisted of highly variable burst pulses, with durations ranging from 0.2 to 7.4 s and a frequency range of 2-20 kHz. BUZZ vocalisations were clearly stereotyped, consisting of a short burst pulse of around 2 s and a frequency range of 2.1 to {\textgreater}22 kHz. Low frequency narrowband grunt vocalisations (0.4-0.8 kHz) were short in duration. Chirp vocalisations were slightly higher in frequency than the grunt vocalisations, ranging in frequency from 2 to 4 kHz. There were at least five different whistle types, ranging in frequency from 4 to 22 kHz. We recorded a combined tonal and burst-pulse vocalisation. The rising whistles ranged from 6 to 18 kHz, while the burst-pulse sounds ranged between 3 and 21 kHz. This combined whistle + burst pulse sound appears to be unique to Risso's dolphins.},

abstract = {Abstract  The duration of periods spent ashore versus foraging at sea, diving behaviour, and diet of lactating female Antarctic (Arctocephalus gazella, AFS) and subantarctic (A. tropicalis, SFS) fur seals were compared at Iles Crozet, where both species coexist. The large disparity in lactation duration (SFS: 10 months, AFS: 4 months), even under local sympatry, has led to the expectation that AFS should exhibit higher foraging effort or efficiency per unit time than SFS to allow them to wean their pups in a shorter period of time. Previous evidence, however, has not supported these expectations. In this study, the distribution of foraging trip durations revealed two types of trips: overnight (OFT, {\textless}1 day) and long (LFT, {\textgreater}1 day), in common with other results from Macquarie Island. However, diving behaviour differed significantly between foraging trip types, with greater diving effort in OFTs than in LFTs, and diving behaviour differed between fur seal species. OFTs were more frequent in SFS (48{\%}) than in AFS (28{\%}). SFS performed longer LFTs and maternal attendances than AFS, but spent a smaller proportion of their foraging cycle at sea (66.2 vs. 77.5{\%}, respectively). SFS dove deeper and for longer periods than AFS, in both OFTs and LFTs, although indices of diving effort were similar between species. Diel variation in diving behaviour was lower among SFS, which foraged at greater depths during most of the night time available than AFS. The diving behaviour of AFS suggests they followed the nychthemeral migration of their prey more closely. Concomitant with the differences in diving behaviour, AFS and SFS fed on the same prey species, but in different proportions of three myctophid fish (Gymnoscopelus fraseri, G. piabilis, and G. nicholsi) that represented most of their diet. The estimated size of the most important fish consumed did not vary significantly between fur seal species, suggesting that the difference in dive depth was mostly a result of changes in the relative abundance of these myctophids. The energy content of these fish at Iles Crozet may thus influence the amount and quality of milk delivered to pups of each fur seal species. These results contrast with those found at other sites where both species coexist, and revealed a scale of variation in foraging behaviour which did not affect their effort while at sea, but that may be a major determinant of foraging efficiency and, consequently, maternal investment.},

abstract = {Abstract   The teleost gasbladder is believed to aid in fish audition by transferring pressure components of incoming sound to the inner ears. This idea is primarily based on both anatomical observations of the mechanical connection between the gasbladder and the ear, followed by physiological experiments by various researchers. The gasbladder movement has been modeled mathematically as a pulsating bubble. This study is extending the previous work on fish with a physical coupling of the gasbladder and ear by investigating hearing in two species (the blue gourami Trichogaster trichopterus, and the oyster toadfish Opsanus tau) without a mechanical linkage. An otophysan specialist (the goldfish Carassius auratus) with mechanical coupling, is used as the control. Audiograms were obtained with acoustically evoked potentials (e.g., auditory brainstem response) from intact fish and from the same individuals with their gasbladders deflated. In blue gourami and oyster toadfish, removal of gas did not significantly change thresholds, and evoked potentials had similar waveforms. In goldfish thresholds increased by 33–55 dB (frequency dependent) after deflation, and major changes in evoked potentials were observed. These results suggest that the gasbladder may not serve an auditory enhancement function in teleost fishes that lack mechanical coupling between the gasbladder and the inner ear.},

abstract = {Management and conservation of populations of animals requires information on where they are, why they are there, and where else they could be. These objectives are typically approached by collecting data on the animals' use of space, relating these positional data to prevailing environmental conditions and employing the resulting statistical models to predict usage at other geographical regions. Technical advances in wildlife telemetry have accomplished manifold increases in the amount and quality of available data, creating the need for a statistical framework that can use them to make population-level inferences for habitat preference and space-use. This has been slow-in-coming because wildlife telemetry data are spatio-temporally autocorrelated, often unbalanced, presence-only observations of behaviourally complex animals, responding to a multitude of cross-correlated environmental variables. We review the evolution of regression models for the analysis of space-use and habitat preference and outline the essential features of a framework that emerges naturally from these foundations. This allows us to derive a relationship between usage of points in geographical space and preference of habitats in environmental space. Within this framework, we discuss eight challenges, inherent in the spatial analysis of telemetry data and, for each, we propose solutions that can work in tandem. Specifically, we propose a logistic, mixed-effects approach that uses generalized additive transformations of the environmental covariates and is fitted to a response data-set comprising the telemetry and simulated observations, under a case-control design. We apply this framework to a non-trivial case-study using satellite-tagged grey seals Halichoerus grypus from the east coast of Scotland. We perform model selection by cross-validation and confront our final model's predictions with telemetry data from the same, as well as different, geographical regions. We conclude that, despite the complex behaviour of the study species, flexible empirical models can capture the environmental relationships that shape population distributions.},

abstract = {The interaction between maternally provided environment and offspring genotype is a major determinant of offspring development and fitness in many organisms. Recent research has demonstrated that not only genetic effects, but also epigenetic effects may be subject to modifications by the maternal environment. Genomic imprinting resulting in parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression is among the best studied of epigenetic effects. However, very little is known about the degree to which genomic imprinting effects can be modulated by the maternally provided environment, which has important implications for phenotypic plasticity. In this study, we investigated this unresolved question using a cross-fostering design in which mouse pups were nursed by either their own or an unrelated mother. We scanned the entire genome to search for quantitative trait loci whose effects depend on cross-fostering and detected 10 of such loci. Of the 10 loci, 4 showed imprinting by cross-foster interactions. In most cases, the interaction effect was due to the presence of an effect in either cross-fostered or non-cross-fostered animals. Our results demonstrate that genomic imprinting effects may often be modified by the maternal environment and that such interactions can impact key fitness-related traits suggesting a greater plasticity of genomic imprinting than previously assumed.},

The envelope-following response (EFR), which is a rhythmic train of auditory brainstem responses (ABR) to sinusoidally amplitude-modulated tones, was used as an indicator of the sound reception by the animal. Variation of the intensity of the stimulus allowed us to measure the animal's hearing via EFR thresholds. During each session, following an initial measure of threshold, the trained animal voluntary positioned itself within a hoop 1 m underwater while a 160 dB re 1 03BCPa noise of a 4201311 kHz bandwidth was presented for 30 min. After the noise exposure, thresholds were measured again at delays of 5, 10, 15, 25, 45, and 105 min. Measurements were made at test frequencies of 8, 11.2, 16, 22.5, and 32 kHz. The maximum TTS occurred 5 min after exposure and rapidly recovered with a rate of around 1.5 dB per doubling of time. TTS occurred at test frequencies from 8 to 16 kHz, with the maximum at 16 kHz.

abstract = {Vocal structure should reflect vocal function. While much attention has focused on quantifying attributes of harmonic vocalizations, the vocalizations of many species also may contain non-linear phenomena such as warbles, subharmonics, biphonation, and deterministic chaos or noise. The function of these non-linearities remains enigmatic. In some species, harmonic vocalizations abruptly become 'noisy' when individuals are physiologically aroused and the sudden onset of these non-linearities could signal arousal or fear to receivers. One untested functional hypothesis is that vocalizations containing non-linearities are more variable from one rendition to the next, and thus are harder to habituate to. In some situations, reducing the likelihood of habituation could be important. Signals that are highly evocative are more difficult to habituate to. Thus, we conducted playback experiments to foraging yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) to determine whether the addition of white noise (a non-linear acoustic phenomenon) to alarm calls elicited a greater response than control calls without the non-linearity or control calls with silence, rather than noise, added to them. Marmots spent less time foraging after hearing calls that included noise than after normal or control calls. This result is consistent with the unpredictability hypothesis and suggests that the adaptive value of non-linearities is to prevent habituation.},

In the tropics, climate change may result in increased hunting pressure on near-shore dolphins and whales off Asia, Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere as the availability of other marine resources diminishes. This study explores the range of potential consequences to cetaceans worldwide from predicted climate-driven shifts in human behavior, and evaluates the risks to particular species given their geographic ranges and habitat preferences. While concern about impacts of climate change on cetaceans has largely focused on polar species, the analysis presented here suggests tropical coastal and riverine cetaceans such as the Irawaddy dolphin, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, and finless porpoise are particularly vulnerable to those aspects of climate change that are mediated by changes in human behavior. Policy recommendations include the following: (1) information about cetacean populations should be incorporated into national, regional and international climate adaptation decisions wherever possible (for example, via GEF-sponsored adaptation initiatives); and (2) human-mediated impacts of climate change should be included in cetacean conservation and management plans, such as the management procedures of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), where possible.

Some aquatic decapod crustaceans produce sounds, and many are able to detect substrate vibration at sensitivities sufficient to tell of the proximity of mates, competitors, or predators. Some semi-terrestrial crabs produce and use sounds for communication. These species detect acoustic stimuli as either air- or substrate-borne energies, socially interact in acoustic "choruses," and probably use "calls" to attract mates.},

abstract = {Beaked whales have mass stranded during some naval sonar exercises, but the cause is unknown. They are difficult to sight but can reliably be detected by listening for echolocation clicks produced during deep foraging dives. Listening for these clicks, we documented Blainville's beaked whales, Mesoplodon densirostris, in a naval underwater range where sonars are in regular use near Andros Island, Bahamas. An array of bottom-mounted hydrophones can detect beaked whales when they click anywhere within the range. We used two complementary methods to investigate behavioral responses of beaked whales to sonar: an opportunistic approach that monitored whale responses to multi-day naval exercises involving tactical mid-frequency sonars, and an experimental approach using playbacks of simulated sonar and control sounds to whales tagged with a device that records sound, movement, and orientation. Here we show that in both exposure conditions beaked whales stopped echolocating during deep foraging dives and moved away. During actual sonar exercises, beaked whales were primarily detected near the periphery of the range, on average 16 km away from the sonar transmissions. Once the exercise stopped, beaked whales gradually filled in the center of the range over 2-3 days. A satellite tagged whale moved outside the range during an exercise, returning over 2-3 days post-exercise. The experimental approach used tags to measure acoustic exposure and behavioral reactions of beaked whales to one controlled exposure each of simulated military sonar, killer whale calls, and band-limited noise. The beaked whales reacted to these three sound playbacks at sound pressure levels below 142 dB re 1 µPa by stopping echolocation followed by unusually long and slow ascents from their foraging dives. The combined results indicate similar disruption of foraging behavior and avoidance by beaked whales in the two different contexts, at exposures well below those used by regulators to define disturbance.},

abstract = {Intraspecific agonistic encounters in snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) were analyzed using single-frame video analysis. The pair of conspecifics in such an encounter are designated as the snapper, which emits a fast water jet by very rapid closure, or snap, of the large modified snapper claw, and the receiver, which is the target of the water jet. The behavior of both snapper and receiver was evaluated before, during, and after the snap. Interactions between two intact shrimp (experimental series I) were compared with those between an intact shrimp and a "deprived" opponent (one with mechanosensory occlusion produced by coating the setae on the snapper claw with clear lacquer) (experimental series II). The behavior of the receiver is significantly changed by the occlusion, but that of the snapper is not. Intact and deprived opponents usually face each other during snapping, which is often preceded by touching of frontal appendages. The mean duration of claw cocking before snapping is about 500 ms. More than 50{\%} of all snaps (and especially initial snaps) are directed towards the opponent, the water jet usually hitting the snapper claw of the receiver from a mean distance of 0.9 cm. Male shrimp show longer cocking durations, keep a shorter distance, and hit their opponents more often than do females. Intact and deprived snappers usually retreat immediately after snapping, but intact receivers usually approach. In contrast, deprived receivers retreat in most cases and show significantly prolonged latencies compared to intact receivers. Thus, mechanoreceptors on the snapper claw of the receiver play a significant role in intraspecific agonistic encounters.},

abstract = {Marine turtles undergo dramatic ontogenic changes in body size and behavior, with the loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta, typically switching from an initial oceanic juvenile stage to one in the neritic, where maturation is reached and breeding migrations are subsequently undertaken every 2 3 years [1 3]. Using satellite tracking, we investigated the migratory movements of adult females from one of the world's largest nesting aggregations at Cape Verde, West Africa. In direct contrast with the accepted life-history model for this species [4], results reveal two distinct adult foraging strategies that appear to be linked to body size. The larger turtles (n = 3) foraged in coastal waters, whereas smaller individuals (n = 7) foraged oceanically. The conservation implications of these findings are profound, with the population compartmentalized into habitats that may be differentially impacted by fishery threats in what is a global fishing hotspot [5]. Although the protection of discrete areas containing coastal individuals may be attainable, the more numerous pelagic individuals are widely dispersed with individuals roaming over more than half a million square kilometers. Therefore, mitigation of fisheries by-catch for sea turtles in the east Atlantic will likely require complex and regionally tailored actions to account for this dichotomous behavior.},

The body of the Ladoga seal is smaller than that of the Saimaa seal or the Baltic ringed seal; its pelage is darker and also craniometrically the Ladoga seal clearly differs from the other subspecies of ringed seal. During summer in Northern Ladoga, the Ladoga ringed seal forms haul-out herds of more than 50 animals. During haul-out in herds the Ladoga seal actively uses different vocalizations. Concentrations of mercury in the liver and kidney of the Ladoga seal are clearly elevated, but levels of the other environmental toxicants analyzed (Cd, Pb, PCB) are comparatively low.},

abstract = {The present study aimed at determining the detection capabilities of an acoustic observation system to recognize porpoises under local riverine conditions and compare the results with sighting observations. Arrays of three to five acoustic data loggers were stationed across the main channel of the Tian-e-zhou Oxbow of China's Yangtze River at intervals of 100-150 m to record sonar. signals of free-ranging finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides). Acoustic observations, concurrent with visual observations, were conducted at two occasions on 20-22 October 2003 and 17-19 October 2004. During a total of 42 h of observation, 316 finless porpoises were sighted and 7041 sonar signals were recorded by loggers. The acoustic data loggers recorded ultrasonic signals of porpoises clearly, and detected the presence of porpoises with a correct detection level of 77.6{\%} and a false alarm level of 5.8{\%} within an effective distance of 150 m. Results indicated that the stationed passive acoustic observation method was effective in detecting the presence of porpoises and showed potential in estimating the group size. A positive linear correlation between the number of recorded signals and the group size of sighted porpoises was indicated, although it is faced with some uncertainty and requires further investigation.

abstract = {The role of oxygen in regulating patterns of gene expression in mammalian development, physiology, and pathology has received increasing attention, especially after the discovery of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a transcription factor that has been likened to a "master switch" in the transcriptional response of mammalian cells and tissues to low oxygen. At present, considerably less is known about the molecular responses of nonmammalian vertebrates and invertebrates to hypoxic exposure. Because many animals live in aquatic habitats that are variable in oxygen tension, it is relevant to study oxygen-dependent gene expression in these animals. The purpose of this review is to discuss hypoxia-induced gene expression in fishes from an evolutionary and ecological context. Recent studies have described homologs of HIF in fish and have begun to evaluate their function. A number of physiological processes are known to be altered by hypoxic exposure of fish, although the evidence linking them to HIF is less well developed. The diversity of fish presents many opportunities to evaluate if inter- and intraspecific variation in HIF structure and function correlate with hypoxia tolerance. Furthermore, as an aquatic group, fish offer the opportunity to examine the interactions between hypoxia and other stressors, including pollutants, common in aquatic environments. It is possible, if not likely, that results obtained by studying the molecular responses of fish to hypoxia will find parallels in the oxygen-dependent responses of mammals, including humans. Moreover, novel responses to hypoxia could be discovered through studies of this diverse and species-rich group.},

abstract = {Time depth recorders were used to assess the patterns of depth utilisation by 2 loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta in Cyprus, eastern Mediterranean. Dives to the seabed accounted for 59{\%} (171 h) and 75{\%} (215 h) of the internesting interval, respectively, with most dives being shallow ({\textless}20 m), suggesting the turtles remained close to the shore. These benthic dives decreased markedly in the days following or prior to a nesting event, suggesting that the behaviours associated with nesting may be protracted. This importance of the seabed for loggerhead turtles in Cyprus contrasts with the far more extensive use of mid-water resting dives recently reported for this species in Japan. Our evidence suggests that this dichotomy may reflect differences in the amount of time spent travelling, with mid-water resting occurring when turtles are travelling and, conversely, when little time is spent travelling turtles opt to remain predominantly on the seabed.  },

abstract = {Humpback whales summer at high latitudes where they feed and winter at low latitudes where they aggregate for breeding. While on the breeding grounds in Hawaii, male humpbacks space themselves and “sing” the long “songs” that have fascinated scientists and poets. Female humpbacks are outnumbered by males and generally ignore or avoid singing males; however, singers often abruptly stop singing and then swim quickly toward distant nonvocalizing whales. Humpback song has usually been explained as sexual advertisement. The suggestion that song is a form of sonar has been dismissed by cetologists on the grounds that the humpback whale song does not resemble the click trains used by toothed whales for echolocation, and that the signal-to-noise ratios of echoes from humpback song are too low for detection. In this paper, we examine humpback whale song and associated behaviors in the light of modern advances in underwater sound and signal processing, buttressing our earlier conclusion that humpback whale song is a long-range sonar used by male humpbacks to locate other whales on the breeding ground. Simulations with the parabolic equation show that the acoustic environment of the breeding ground (100-500 m water depth, weak surface duct, and sandy bottom) is often excellent for sonar in the 4-5 octave band of humpback song, enabling singers to locate other pods at ranges up to 6 km. All humpback whale behaviors are consistent with the sonar model. In particular, the sonar model explains how singing males find nonvocalizing females, despite the fact that females generally ignore or avoid singers. It also explains why males hardly ever sing while in the company of females or while competing with other males for the position of primary escort. A secondary purpose of the paper is to allay a confusion in the cetology literature between specialized structures for high frequency localization and echolocation itself, which takes place in the brain. Modern sonar algorithms, which do not require click-type sources and which appear to be mimicked in more robust forms in the brains of bats, suggest that, when dealing with any cetacean, it is always more conservative to presume that echoes are being used than that they are not being used. Many cetacean vocalizations currently thought to be exclusively for communication undoubtedly also have a sonar function. An experiment is proposed to test the humpback sonar model},

abstract = {The method of generalized estimating equations (GEE) models the association between the repeated observations on a subject with a patterned correlation matrix. Correct specification of the underlying structure is a potentially beneficial goal, in terms of improving efficiency and enhancing scientific understanding. We consider two sets of criteria that have previously been suggested, respectively, for selecting an appropriate working correlation structure, and for ruling out a particular structure(s), in the GEE analysis of longitudinal studies with binary outcomes. The first selection criterion chooses the structure for which the model-based and the sandwich-based estimator of the covariance matrix of the regression parameter estimator are closest, while the second selection criterion chooses the structure that minimizes the weighted error sum of squares. The rule out criterion deselects structures for which the estimated correlation parameter violates standard constraints for binary data that depend on the marginal means. In addition, we remove structures from consideration if their estimated parameter values yield an estimated correlation structure that is not positive definite. We investigate the performance of the two sets of criteria using both simulated and real data, in the context of a longitudinal trial that compares two treatments for major depressive episode. Practical recommendations are also given on using these criteria to aid in the efficient selection of a working correlation structure in GEE analysis of longitudinal binary data.},

abstract = {Drag and buoyancy are two primary external forces acting on diving marine mammals. The strength of these forces modulates the energetic cost of movement and may influence swimming style (gait). Here we use a high-resolution digital tag to record depth, 3-D orientation, and sounds heard and produced by 23 deep-diving sperm whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Periods of active thrusting versus gliding were identified through analysis of oscillations measured by a 3-axis accelerometer. Accelerations during 382 ascent glides of five whales (which made two or more steep ascents and for which we obtained a measurement of length) were strongly affected by depth and speed at Reynold's numbers of 1.4-2.8x10(7). The accelerations fit a model of drag, air buoyancy and tissue buoyancy forces with an r(2) of 99.1-99.8{\%} for each whale. The model provided estimates (mean +/- S.D.) of the drag coefficient (0.00306+/-0.00015), air carried from the surface (26.4+/-3.9 l kg(-3) mass), and tissue density (1030+/-0.8 kg m(-3)) of these five animals. The model predicts strong positive buoyancy forces in the top 100 m of the water column, decreasing to near neutral buoyancy at 250-850 m. Mean descent speeds (1.45+/-0.19 m s(-1)) were slower than ascent speeds (1.63+/-0.22 m s(-1)), even though sperm whales stroked steadily (glides 5.3+/-6.3{\%}) throughout descents and employed predominantly stroke-and-glide swimming (glides 37.7+/-16.4{\%}) during ascents. Whales glided more during portions of dives when buoyancy aided their movement, and whales that glided more during ascent glided less during descent (and vice versa), supporting the hypothesis that buoyancy influences behavioural swimming decisions. One whale rested at approximately 10 m depth for more than 10 min without fluking, regulating its buoyancy by releasing air bubbles.},

abstract = {Mammals exposed to loud aerial sounds exhibit temporary threshold shifts (TTS) that are linearly related to increases of sound pressure above baseline hearing levels. It was unknown if this relationship held true for aquatic ectotherms such as fishes. To test this linear threshold shift hypothesis (LINTS) in fishes, we examined the effects of increased ambient sound on hearing of two species differing in hearing capabilities: goldfish (Carassius auratus; a hearing specialist) and tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus; a hearing generalist). Fish were exposed to 1-28 days of either quiet (110 dB re 1 microPa) or continuous white noise. First, we examined the effect of noise sound pressure level (SPL; 130, 140, 160 or 170 dB re 1 microPa) on goldfish hearing thresholds after 24 h of noise exposure. Second, in a long-term experiment using 170 dB re 1 microPa white noise, we continuously exposed goldfish and tilapia for either 7 or 21-28 days. In both experiments, we measured alterations in hearing capabilities (using auditory brainstem responses) of noise-exposed fish. While tilapia exposed to noise for 28 days showed little or no hearing loss, goldfish exhibited considerable threshold shifts that reached an asymptote of up to 25 dB after only 24 h of exposure. There was a positive linear relationship between noise-induced TTS and the sound pressure difference between the noise and the baseline hearing thresholds in goldfish but not in tilapia. A similar relationship was found for published noise-induced threshold shifts in birds and mammals, but the slope of the linear relationship was greater in these groups than for fish. The linear threshold shift relationship provides insights into differential susceptibility of hearing specialist and generalist fishes to noise-induced hearing loss for a given SPL and provides a framework for future research on noise-induced threshold shifts in fishes and other animals.},

abstract = {Big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, can be trained to use echolocation to track a small microphone with a food reward attached when it is moved rapidly toward them.  This situation mimics prey interception in the wild while allowing very precise recording of the sonar pulses emitted during tracking behavior.  The results show that E. fuscus intensity compensates, reducing emitted intensity by 6 dB per halving of target range so that the intensity incident upon the target is constant and echo intensity increases by 6 dB per halving of range.  This increase in echo intensity is effectively canceled by the reduction in auditory sensitivity due to automatic gain control (AGC) of 6 to 7 dB per halving of range.  Intensity compensation behavior and AGC therefore form a dual-component, symmetrical system that stabilizes perceived echo amplitudes during target approach.  The same system is present in the fishing bat, Noctilio leporinus, suggesting that it may be widespread in echolocating bats.  Correlation analysis shows that, despite large changes in the duration of the pulses emitted by E. fuscus during an approach, the pulse frequency structure is such that the spatial image of the target perceived along the range axis is highly stable.  Pulse duration is not reduced in the manner theoretically necessary to eliminate potential echo distortion effects due to AGC, but is reduced in such a way that this distortion is insignificant.  During the terminal buzz, a high degree of temporal overlap (relative to pulse duration) occurs between emitted pulse and returning echo.},

abstract = {Animals rely mainly on olfaction to locate and track food sources. However, mammals that have evolved to live partially or fully underwater are unable to use traditional olfaction in the foraging process. These animals have subsequently developed alternative underwater foraging techniques. Cetaceans (e.g. dolphins) live exclusively underwater, and most utilize a highly developed sonar system for navigation and tracking of prey. Pinnipeds (e.g. seals) live on land, but forage underwater. These animals' highly sensitive whiskers allow them to locate food sources. Sirenians (e.g. manatees), the only herbivorous aquatic mammals, also use highly developed whiskers during the grazing process. The semiaquatic mammals Condylura cristata (star-nosed mole) and Sortex palustris (water shrew) have developed the ability to sniff and detect semiochemicals underwater, a discovery that contradicts prior views on the evolutionary relationship between olfaction and aquatic adaptation. The current review details the anatomy of the olfactory systems of these mammals that live and/or forage underwater, and the adaptations they use to follow prey and forage underwater.},

abstract = {Many species of odontocete cetaceans (toothed whales) use high-frequency clicks (60-170 kHz) to identify objects in their environment, including potential prey. Behavioral studies have shown that American shad, Alosa sapidissima, can detect ultrasonic signals similar to those of odontocetes that are potentially their predators. American shad also show strong escape behavior in response to ultrasonic pulses between 70 and 110 kHz and can determine the location of the sound source at least in the horizontal plane. The present study examines physiological aspects of ultrasound detection by American shad and provides the first insights into the neural encoding of ultrasound signals in any nonmammalian vertebrate. The recordings were obtained by penetration through the cerebellar surface. All but two units responded exclusively to ultrasound. Ultrasound-sensitive units did not phase-couple to any stimulus frequency. Some units resembled the response of constant latency neurons found in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus of bats. We suggest that ultrasonic and sonic signals are processed along different pathways in Alosa. The ultrasonic pathway in Alosa appears to be a feature detector that is likely to be adapted (e.g., frequency, intensity) to odontocete echolocation signals.},

The pulses occurred predominantly in pairs and once in a trio. The sounds are simpler than those of most baleen whales, but they show some similarity in characteristics.

abstract = {Muscle fatigue, a reduction in force as a consequence of exercise, is an important factor for any animal that moves, and can result from both peripheral and/or central mechanisms. Although much is known about whole-limb force generation and activation patterns in fatigued muscles under sustained isometric contractions, little is known about the in vivo dynamics of limb muscle function in relation to whole-body fatigue. Here we show that limb kinematics and contractile function in the lateral (LG) and medial (MG) gastrocnemius of helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris) are significantly altered following fatiguing exercise at 2ms−1 on an inclined treadmill. The two most significant findings were that the variation in muscle force generation, measured directly from the muscles' tendons, increased significantly with fatigue, and fascicle shortening in the proximal MG, but not the distal MG, decreased significantly with fatigue. We suggest that the former is a potential mechanism for decreased stability associated with fatigue. The region-specific alteration of fascicle behaviour within the MG as a result of fatigue suggests a complex response to fatigue that probably depends on muscle–aponeurosis and tendon architecture not previously explored. These findings highlight the importance of studying the integrative in vivo dynamics of muscle function in response to fatigue.},

Silent ships do not always encounter more fish: comparison of acoustic backscatter recorded by a noise-reduced and a conventional research vessel. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 623-635. The extent to which fish avoid approaching research vessels is an important source of uncertainty in fisheries surveys. Vessels radiate noise at the frequencies where fish hearing is most sensitive, and noise is thus thought to be the primary stimulus for vessel avoidance. In an effort to minimize vessel avoidance, international standards for noise emission by research vessels have been established. Although vessels meeting these criteria are now in service, the effectiveness of noise quietening on vessel avoidance remains poorly understood. The new, noise-reduced, RV "Oscar Dyson" (OD) will augment the conventionally constructed research vessel, "Miller Freeman" (MF) and serve as the primary platform in conducting acoustic surveys of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) in Alaska. To investigate whether noise-reduction measures result in differential avoidance, which would bias the pollock abundance time-series, we conducted an inter-vessel comparison of acoustic backscatter recorded by OD and MF during a survey of walleye pollock in 2006 in the eastern Bering Sea. Overall, we found no evidence for differences in vessel avoidance that would impact the echo integration results of adult pollock. Analysis of pollock depth distributions from both vessels suggests that there is a comparatively greater diving response to OD, with the reaction taking place primarily after the vessel has passed and for fish shallower than 90 m. Given that the change in vertical distribution is after the fish have been detected by the echosounder, this reaction should not influence echo-integration measurements. The results indicate that use of the OD rather than the MF is unlikely to bias the Bering Sea survey time-series through changes in vessel avoidance by adult walleye pollock.},

abstract = {United States and Canadian governments have responded to legal requirements to reduce human-induced whale mortality via vessel strikes and entanglement in fishing gear by implementing a suite of regulatory actions. We analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of mortality of large whales in the Northwest Atlantic (23.5°N to 48.0°N), 1970 through 2009, in the context of management changes. We used a multinomial logistic model fitted by maximum likelihood to detect trends in cause-specific mortalities with time. We compared the number of human-caused mortalities with U.S. federally established levels of potential biological removal (i.e., species-specific sustainable human-caused mortality). From 1970 through 2009, 1762 mortalities (all known) and serious injuries (likely fatal) involved 8 species of large whales. We determined cause of death for 43{\%} of all mortalities; of those, 67{\%} (502) resulted from human interactions. Entanglement in fishing gear was the primary cause of death across all species (n = 323), followed by natural causes (n = 248) and vessel strikes (n = 171). Established sustainable levels of mortality were consistently exceeded in 2 species by up to 650{\%}. Probabilities of entanglement and vessel-strike mortality increased significantly from 1990 through 2009. There was no significant change in the local intensity of all or vessel-strike mortalities before and after 2003, the year after which numerous mitigation efforts were enacted. So far, regulatory efforts have not reduced the lethal effects of human activities to large whales on a population-range basis, although we do not exclude the possibility of success of targeted measures for specific local habitats that were not within the resolution of our analyses. It is unclear how shortfalls in management design or compliance relate to our findings. Analyses such as the one we conducted are crucial in critically evaluating wildlife-management decisions. The results of these analyses can provide managers with direction for modifying regulated measures and can be applied globally to mortality-driven conservation issues.},

abstract = {American lobsters produce carapace vibrations, which also lead to waterborne acoustic signals, by simultaneously contracting the antagonistic remotor and promotor muscles located at the base of the second antenna. These vibrations have a mean frequency of 183.1 Hz (range 87-261 Hz), range in duration from 68 to 1720 ms (mean 277.1 ms) and lead to waterborne sounds of similar frequencies. Lobsters most often produce these signals using only one pair of muscles at a time and alternate between the muscles of the left and right antennae when making a series of vibrations. Occasionally, they vibrate their carapace by simultaneously contracting both sets of muscles. While the remotor muscle is required for producing carapace vibrations, the promotor appears to play a secondary role. Electrical stimulation of the remotor, but not the promotor, results in the production of vibrations, while lesions of the remotor, but not promotor, eliminate the ability of lobsters to vibrate their carapace. Lobsters of all sizes and both sexes produce these signals when startled, grasped or threatened. However, at this time, the behavioral significance of vibration and/or sound production by American lobsters is not known.},

The application of this technology has resulted in a need to understand the auditory physiology of the target species, in order to maximise the effect of the barrier in preventing the migration of the non-indigenous carp species into Lake Michigan, whilst minimising the effect on indigenous fish populations. Therefore, the hearing thresholds of 12 H. molitrix and 12 A. nobilis were defined using the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) technique, in a pressure-dominated sound field generated by submerged transducers of the type used in the construction of the BAFF system. The results clearly show that these fish are most sensitive to sounds in a frequency bandwidth of between 750 Hz and 1500 Hz, with higher thresholds below 300 Hz and above 2000 Hz.

Clupeiform fishes are unique in that they have specialized gas-filled bullae in the head associated with the ear via the bulla membrane and with the lateral line via the lateral recess membrane. It has been hypothesized that the utricle of the inner ear is responsible for ultrasound detection through a specialized connection to the gas-filled bullae complex. Here, we show that the lateral line and its connection to the gas-filled bullae complex via the lateral recess are involved in ultrasound detection in Gulf menhaden. Removal of a small portion of the lateral line overlying the lateral recess membrane eliminates the ability of Gulf menhaden to detect ultrasound. We further show that the gas-filled bullae vibrates in response to ultrasound, that the gas-filled bullae are necessary for detecting ultrasound, and that the bullae connections to the lateral line via the lateral recess membrane play an important role in ultrasound detection.

abstract = {1) Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) produce a series of beautiful and varied sounds for a period of 7 to 30 minutes and then repeat the same series with considerable precision. We call such a performance "singing" and each repeated series of sounds a "song."2) All prolonged sound patterns (recorded so far) of this species are in song form, and each individual adheres to its own song type.3) There seem to be several song types around which whales construct their songs, but individual variations are pronounced (there is only a very rough species-specific song pattern).4) Songs are repeated without any obvious pause between them; thus song sessions may continue for several hours.5) The sequence of themes in successive songs by the same individual is the same. Although the number of phrases per theme varies, no theme is ever completely omitted in our sample.6) Loud sounds in the ocean, for example dynamite blasts, do not seem to affect the whale's songs.7) The sex of the performer of any of the songs we have studied is unknown.8) The function of the songs is unknown.},

abstract = {The conventional theory about the snail shell shape of the mammalian cochlea is that it evolved essentially and perhaps solely to conserve space inside the skull. Recently, a theory proposed that the spiral's graded curvature enhances the cochlea's mechanical response to low frequencies. This article provides a multispecies analysis of cochlear shape to test this theory and demonstrates that the ratio of the radii of curvature from the outermost and innermost turns of the cochlear spiral is a significant cochlear feature that correlates strongly with low-frequency hearing limits. The ratio, which is a measure of curvature gradient, is a reflection of the ability of cochlear curvature to focus acoustic energy at the outer wall of the cochlear canal as the wave propagates toward the apex of the cochlea.},

abstract = {Mortality of harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) as a result of interactions with commercial gill-net fisheries in the Bay of Fundy - Gulf of Maine region has prompted evaluation of the problem and of possible mitigation measures. Observer coverage was made of gill-net vessels in the lower Bay of Fundy, Canada, in 1993 and 1994. Porpoise by-catch rates peaked during August, with 72{\%} of the estimated total by-catch being taken during this month, The two areas characterized by high by-catch spanned 24 and 7 km(2). This spatiotemporal pattern of by-catch allows for effective mitigation measures without affecting the entire gill-net activity in the Bay of Fundy. The estimated porpoise by-catch in 1993 among the Fundy Isles was 424 +/- 224 (mean +/- SE), and in 1994 the by-catch was 101 (95{\%} confidence limits 80-122). Uncertainty exists in the 1993 estimate because of low observer coverage and the absence of temporal stratification. Ninety-six percent of captured porpoises were located in the upper two thirds of the 4-5 m high gill nets. When by-catch estimates for the Gulf of Maine were included, the combined by-catch for the entire transboundary population in 1993 was similar to 1800 porpoises and ranged from 2.7 to 4.3{\%} of total population size.},

abstract = {Water and air temperature are potentially limiting factors to the pole-ward distributions of coastal bottlenose dolphins. This study assessed the lower critical temperature of captive bottlenose dolphins to air temperature (LCT(a)) and water temperature (LCT(w)) through the use of open flow respirometry. Five dolphins, ranging from 14 to 33 years of age and acclimated to the waters of the southern California coast (14.2-22.5 degrees C), were subjected to water temperatures ranging from 0.2 to 18.0 degrees C. Two of the animals were additionally subjected to air temperatures ranging from -2.4 to 17.8 degrees C while maintaining water temperature approximately 3 degrees C above their individual LCT(w). The LCT(w) ranged from 5.5 to 10.6 degrees C and generally decreased with increasing animal mass; for dolphins in excess of 187 kg, the LCT(w) ranged from 5.5 to 5.7 degrees C. No LCT(a) could be determined across the range of air temperatures tested. Core body temperature remained within the limits of normal body temperatures reported for dolphins but demonstrated a direct relationship to water temperature in three subjects and varied across a range of 1.5 degrees C. Air and water temperature had a minimal synergistic effect on dolphin thermoregulation, i.e. water temperature exerted the predominant impact on thermoregulation. For dolphins in excess of 187 kg, water temperature alone would appear to be insufficient to limit the use of habitat north of current bottlenose dolphin ranges along the coastal United States. However, thermal impacts to smaller dolphins, in particular adolescents, neonates and accompanying females, may work in concert with other factors (e.g. prey distribution, predator avoidance, social interactions) to influence coastal residency patterns and population structure.},

abstract = {Acoustic signals from wild Neophocaena phocaenoides sunameri were recorded in the waters off Liao-dong-wan Bay located in Bohai Sea, China. Signal analysis shows that N. p. sunameri produced "typical" phocoenid clicks. The peak frequencies f(p), of clicks ranged from. 113 to 131 kHz with an average of 121 +/- 3.78 kHz (n=71). The 3 dB bandwidths Delta f ranged from 10.9 to 25.0 kHz with an average of 17.5 +/- 3.30 kHz. The signal durations At ranged from 56 to 109 mu s with an average 80 +/- 11.49 mu s. The number of cycles N, ranged from 7 to 13 with an average of 9 +/- 1.48. With increasing peak frequency there was a faint tendency of decrease in bandwidth, which implies a nonconstant value of f(p)/Delta f. On occasion there were some click trains with faint click energy presenting below 70 kHz, however, it was possibly introduced by interference effect from multiple pulses structures. The acoustic parameters of the clicks were compared between the investigated population and a riverine population of finless porpoise. (c) 2007 Acoustical Society of America.},

Within a large herd: harp seal call numbers varied slightly between channels. Counts of Weddell seal calls were higher near a small herd on the ice than 159-180 m away, Repeat counts of harp seal calls by a single observer differed significantly. Source levels of Weddell seal calls varied and higher amplitude calls would be detected up to 2 orders of magnitude farther away than quieter calls. Hydrophone location (especially near small groups), observer variability and call source level differences will bias the use of monitoring underwater seal vocalizations to index locations, population size or underwater behaviours. Using hydrophone arrays and multiple observers may mitigate these problems.},

abstract = {New information about the effects of seismic surveys on cetaceans is causing increasing concern about the impact of this type of activity on marine life. The effects described include behavioral responses and changes in vocalization patterns, diversion of migratory routes, damage to the auditory system, and an increase in strandings. Although such effects could affect the diversity of species in areas where seismic research has been carried out, there is no scientific information on this subject. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between seismic surveys, oceanographic data and diversity of cetaceans recorded in Brazil following the stepping up of seismic survey activities between 1999 and 2004. The study is based on oceanographic data from the Pilot Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA Project), sightings made during seismic surveys, progress reports from Brazilian research projects to the International Whaling Commission, Brazilian seismic survey reports available at the Escrit{\'{o}}rio de Licenciamento de Petr{\'{o}}leo e Nuclear of the Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renov{\'{a}}veis (ELPN-Ibama) and complementary data from the webpage of the Agencia Nacional de Petr{\'{o}}leo e G{\'{a}}s Natural (ANP). The results suggest a decrease in the diversity of species in the face of an increase in the number of seismic surveys during the years 2000 and 2001, even though there was no significant change in oceanographic patterns in this period, and that a relationship exists between diversity of cetaceans and intensity of seismic surveys between 1999 and 2004. It is recommended that data collection be improved in order to evaluate this hypothesis properly. The results suggest that species diversity might be used as a long-term indicator of the impact of seismic surveys on cetaceans.},

abstract = {The goals of this review are to summarize existing information available on aquatic mating strategies in pinnipeds. Considerable advances in knowledge concerning the reproductive strategies of aquatic mating pinnipeds have been made over recent years. Studies have showed that aquatic mating pinnipeds exhibit a range of evolutionary adaptations in their reproductive strategies that differ considerably from those of land-breeding species. However, clear gaps still exist, particularly amongst ice-breeding species. This review introduces the topic and then is divided into 1) techniques for studying aquatic mating pinnipeds, of which acoustic, telemetry, and genetic technologies are discussed, 2) evolutionary consequences of lactation and whelping habitat, 3) male reproductive strategies and, 4) conclusions and future research directions. Based on current evidence, aquatic-mating species are thought to maintain aquatic display areas using vocal and dive displays for the purpose of male–male competition and likely for the attractioon of females. Between species, mating behaviour ranges from lek mating, female defense polygyny, to the use of alternative mating tactics. Observed variations within species in mating behaviour appear to be linked to the influences of local habitat type and changes in female behaviour. Therefore, it is appropriate to reassess our knowledge concerning aquatic breeders and reflect how this alters the development of theories on the evolution of pinniped reproductive strategies.},

abstract = {Yangtze finless porpoises were surveyed by using simultaneous visual and acoustical methods from 6 November to 13 December 2006. Two research vessels towed stereo acoustic data loggers, which were used to store the intensity and sound source direction of the high frequency sonar signals produced by finless porpoises at detection ranges up to 300 m on each side of the vessel. Simple stereo beam forming allowed the separation of distinct biosonar sound source, which enabled us to count the number of vocalizing porpoises. Acoustically, 204 porpoises were detected from one vessel and 199 from the other vessel in the same section of the Yangtze River. Visually, 163 and 162 porpoises were detected from two vessels within 300 m of the vessel track. The calculated detection probability using acoustic method was approximately twice that for visual detection for each vessel. The difference in detection probabilities between the two methods was caused by the large number of single individuals that were missed by visual observers. However, the sizes of large groups were underestimated by using the acoustic methods. Acoustic and visual observations complemented each other in the accurate detection of porpoises. The use of simple, relatively inexpensive acoustic monitoring systems should enhance population surveys of free-ranging, echolocating odontocetes. (C) 2008 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {Dolphins and porpoises have excellent biosonar ability, which they use for navigation, ranging and foraging. However, the role of biosonar in free-ranging small cetaceans has not been fully investigated. The biosonar behaviour and body movements of 15 free-ranging finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides) were observed using electronic tags attached to the animals. The porpoises often rotated their bodies more than 60 deg., on average, around the body axis in a dive bout. This behaviour occupied 31{\%} of the dive duration during 186 h of effective observation time. Rolling dives were associated with extensive searching effort, and 23{\%} of the rolling dive time was phonated, almost twice the phonation ratio of upright dives. Porpoises used short inter-click interval sonar 4.3 times more frequently during rolling dives than during upright dives. Sudden speed drops, which indicated that an individual turned around, occurred 4.5 times more frequently during rolling dives than during upright dives. Together, these data suggest that the porpoises searched extensively for targets and rolled their bodies to enlarge the search area by changing the narrow beam axis of the biosonar. Once a possible target was detected, porpoises frequently produced short-range sonar sounds. Continuous searching for prey and frequent capture trials appeared to occur during rolling dives of finless porpoises. In contrast, head movements ranging {\{}+/-{\}}2 cm, which can also change the beam axis, were regularly observed during both dives. Head movements might assist in instant assessment of the arbitrary direction by changing the beam axis rather than prey searching and pursuit.},

The high-frequency hearing of these animals was found to vary inversely with interaural distance, a typical mammalian pattern. With regard to low-frequency hearing, the animals fell into two groups: those with extended low-frequency hearing (chipmunks, groundhogs, and hamsters hear below 100 Hz) and those with restricted low-frequency hearing (spiny and leaf-eared mice do not hear appreciably below 1 kHz). An analysis of mammalian hearing reveals that the distribution of low-frequency hearing limits is bimodal with the two distributions separated by a gap from 125 to 500 Hz. The correspondence of this dichotomy with studies of temporal coding raises the possibility that mammals that do not hear below 500 Hz do not use temporal encoding for the perception of pitch.

abstract = {A method is developed to account for effects of animal movement in response to sighting platforms in line transect density estimates using data on animal orientation. Models of expected distributions of animal orientation show that presence of responsive movement is determined by the ratio of animal sightings with angles of orientation in the third quadrant relative to the first quadrant. The distance at which response began is estimated using logistic generalized additive models of the relationship between radial distance and orientation. Density corrected for responsive movement is estimated by applying the Buckland and Turnock two-team analysis method to data poststratified into regions "close" to and "far" from (beyond the distance that responsive movement began) the observation platform instead of the original stratification by observation team. For data collected in the North Atlantic, white-sided dolphins, harbor porpoises, and minke whales responded by avoiding the survey ship, and white-beaked dolphins were attracted to the ship. For these populations, our method to correct for responsive movement gave significantly higher estimates, from 1.4 to 2.7 times the uncorrected estimates.

abstract = {The cost of vocal behaviour is usually expressed in energetic terms; however, many animals may pay additional costs when predators or potential prey eavesdrop on their vocal communication. The northeastern Pacific is home to two distinct ecotypes of killer whales, Orcinus orca, called residents and transients. Resident killer whales feed on fish, a prey with poor hearing abilities, whereas transient killer whales hunt marine mammals, which have sensitive underwater hearing within the frequency range of killer whale vocal communication. In this study, we investigated how the superior hearing ability of mammalian prey has shaped the vocal behaviour of the transient killer whale ecotype. We recorded pulsed calls and the associated behavioural context of groups of transient and resident killer whales in British Columbia and southeastern Alaska. Transient killer whales produced pulsed calls significantly less frequently than residents. Transient killer whales only showed significant amounts of vocal behaviour after a marine mammal kill or when the whales were displaying surface-active behaviour. Vocal activity of transients increased after a successful attack on a marine mammal. Since marine mammals are able to detect killer whale pulsed calls and respond with antipredator behaviour, the reduced vocal activity of transients is probably due to a greater cost for calling in this ecotype resulting from eavesdropping by potential prey. The increase in vocal behaviour after a successful attack may represent food calling (informing other animals in the area about the presence of food), but is more likely to reflect an increase in social interactions during feeding and/or the fact that the cost for vocal behaviour is comparatively low after a successful attack.},

abstract = {1. Many organisms depend on sound for communication, predator/prey detection and navigation. The acoustic environment can therefore play an important role in ecosystem dynamics and evolution. A growing number of studies are documenting acoustic habitats and their influences on animal development, behaviour, physiology and spatial ecology, which has led to increasing demand for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) expertise in the life sciences. However, as yet, there has been no synthesis of data processing methods for acoustic habitat monitoring, which presents an unnecessary obstacle to would-be PAM analysts. 2. Here, we review the signal processing techniques needed to produce calibrated measurements of terrestrial and aquatic acoustic habitats. We include a supplemental tutorial and template computer codes in matlab and r, which give detailed guidance on how to produce calibrated spectrograms and statistical analyses of sound levels. Key metrics and terminology for the characterisation of biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic sound are covered, and their application to relevant monitoring scenarios is illustrated through example data sets. To inform study design and hardware selection, we also include an up-to-date overview of terrestrial and aquatic PAM instruments. 3. Monitoring of acoustic habitats at large spatiotemporal scales is becoming possible through recent advances in PAM technology. This will enhance our understanding of the role of sound in the spatial ecology of acoustically sensitive species and inform spatial planning to mitigate the rising influence of anthropogenic noise in these ecosystems. As we demonstrate in this work, progress in these areas will depend upon the application of consistent and appropriate PAM methodologies.},

The statistical analysis of these studies presents difficulties and standard methods are inadequate.METHODS:We consider strategies for modelling binary repeated responses and focus on two specific issues: the choice between marginal and random-effects models, and the choice of the time point origin. These issues are addressed using the example of self-reported disability in older women assessed annually for 6 years. The indicator of disability "needing help to go outdoors or home-confined" is used.RESULTS:In view of the observed associations between the responses for consecutive years, the baseline response was considered as a covariate. We compared the marginal and random-effects models first when only the influence of time and age is analysed and second when individual risk factors are studied in an aetiological perspective. There were substantial differences between the parameter estimates. They were due to differences between specific concepts related to the two models and the large between-individual heterogeneity revealed by the analysis.CONCLUSIONS:A random-effects model appears to be most suitable for the analysis of self-reported disability in older women.},

Anatomical observations on a range of fossil and living marine and freshwater mammals are presented, including sirenians (manatees and dugongs), cetaceans (both baleen whales and toothed whales, including dolphins and porpoises), pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses), the sea otter, and the pygmy hippopotamus. A range of anatomical systems are covered in this issue, including the external form (integument, tail shape), nervous system (eye, ear, brain), musculoskeletal systems (cranium, mandible, hyoid, vertebral column, flipper/forelimb), digestive tract (teeth/tusks/baleen, tongue, stomach), and respiratory tract (larynx). Emphasis is placed on exploring anatomical function in the context of aquatic life. The following topics are addressed: evolution, sound production, sound reception, feeding, locomotion, buoyancy control, thermoregulation, cognition, and behavior. A variety of approaches and techniques are used to examine and characterize these adaptations, ranging from dissection, to histology, to electron microscopy, to two-dimensional (2D) and 3D computerized tomography, to experimental field tests of function. The articles in this issue are a blend of literature review and new, hypothesis-driven anatomical research, which highlight the special nature of anatomical form and function in aquatic mammals that enables their exquisite adaptation for life in such a challenging environment.

abstract = {Recent cetacean mass strandings in close temporal and spatial association with sonar activity has raised the concern that anthropogenic sound may harm breath-hold diving marine mammals. Necropsy results of the stranded whales have shown evidence of bubbles in the tissues, similar to those in human divers suffering from decompression sickness (DCS). It has been proposed that changes in behavior or physiological responses during diving could increase tissue and blood N2 levels, thereby increasing DCS risk. Dive data recorded from sperm, killer, long-finned pilot, Blainville's beaked and Cuvier's beaked whales before and during exposure to low- (1-2 kHz) and mid- (2-7 kHz) frequency active sonar were used to estimate the changes in blood and tissue N2 tension (PN2). Our objectives were to determine if differences in 1) dive behavior or 2) physiological responses to sonar are plausible risk factors for bubble formation. The theoretical estimates indicate that all species may experience high N2 levels. However, unexpectedly, deep diving generally result in higher end-dive PN2 as compared with shallow diving. In this focused review we focus on three possible explanations: 1) We revisit an old hypothesis that CO2, because of its much higher diffusivity, form bubble precursors that continue to grow in N2 supersaturated tissues. Such a mechanism would be less dependent on the alveolar collapse depth but affected by elevated levels of CO2 following a burst of activity during sonar exposure. 2) During deep dives, a greater duration of time might be spent at depths where gas exchange continues as compared with shallow dives. The resulting elevated levels of N2 in deep diving whales might also make them more susceptible to anthropogenic disturbances. 3) Extended duration of dives even at depths beyond where the alveoli collapse could result in slow continuous accumulation of N2 in the adipose tissues that eventually becomes a liability.},

abstract = {Abstract: Acoustic communication range estimates for four northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) vocalization types are presented for this species. Maximum signal detection ranges are determined using an integrated approach involving: field measurements of vocalization source levels and spectral characteristics, signal directivity patterns, natural ambient noise measurements, and previously collected laboratory audiometric data. Signals and masking noise were analyzed using two filter bandwidths believed to approximate the upper and lower limit of auditory filter widths for the northern elephant seal auditory system. Signal detection ranges are estimated for representative pup 'female attraction calls' (FAC), adult female 'pup attraction calls' (PAC), adult female 'threat calls' (AFT), and adult male 'clap threat calls' (AMCT) in each of three intensity categories for biotic noise, wave noise, and wind noise. Signal detection ranges in these nine natural masking noise conditions vary from 5-70 m for FAC, 10-105 m for PAC, 41- 479 m for AFT, and 59-507 m for AMCT. The results demonstrate the extent to which communication ranges in the field can vary depending on call type, signal directivity, ambient noise conditions, and receiver capabilities. These data are also useful in considering natural constraints on acoustic communication in northern elephant seals, selective pressures on signal production and reception systems, and potential negative effects of anthropogenic noise.  },

The maximum sound energy was emitted between 30 and 800 Hz with peak source levels of 128 dB (re 1 muPa(2) Hz(-1) at 1 m) at 80 and 160 Hz (1/3-octave centre frequencies). This simulated 2 MW wind-turbine noise was played back on calm days ({\textless}1 Beaufort) to free-ranging harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena and harbour seals Phoca vitulina in Fortune Channel, Vancouver Island, Canada. Swimming tracks of porpoises and surfacings of seals were recorded with an electronic theodolite situated on a clifftop 14 m above sea level. Echolocation activity of harbour porpoises close to the sound source was recorded simultaneously via an electronic click detector placed below the transducer. In total we tracked 375 porpoise groups and 157 seals during play-back experiments, and 380 porpoise groups and 141 surfacing seals during controls. Both species showed a distinct reaction to wind-turbine noise. Surfacings in harbour seals were recorded at larger distances from the sound source (median = 284 vs 239 in during controls; p = 0.008, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and closest approaches increased from a median of 120 to 182 m (p {\textless} 0.001) in harbour porpoises. Furthermore, the number of time intervals during which porpoise echolocation clicks were detected increased by a factor of 2 when the sound source was active (19.6{\%} of all 1 min intervals as opposed to 8.4{\%} of all intervals during controls; p {\textless} 0.001). These results show that harbour porpoises and harbour seals are able to detect the low-frequency sound generated by offshore wind-turbines. Controlled exposure experiments such as the one described here are a first step to assess the impact on marine mammals of the new offshore wind-turbine industry.},

abstract = {The extent and spatial pattern of song similarity in the chowchilla were examined to determine at what scale song similarity changes, and whether this pattern is indicative of the timing of learning and dispersal strategy of this rainforest passerine. We recorded songs from across the species' entire range in the Wet Tropics of Australia. Songs were divided into their syllables, and a syllable catalogue was created for the whole population. Pairwise comparisons of syllable sharing were used to calculate a similarity index for each recorded group as well as for neighbours and non-neighbours. Chowchillas have a single-song repertoire, which is primarily used in territorial defence. Chowchillas show exceptional spatial variation in their song, and song similarity was significantly correlated with distance. Song similarity decreased sharply at 1 km, confirming the existence of song neighbourhoods that share near identical songs. Neighbours shared significantly more syllables than non-neighbours. Our results are consistent with the idea that chowchillas learn their songs after dispersal when settling into a new group.},

abstract = {In the most common models of communication, it is assumed that animals provide reliable information about phenotype, and hence can settle competitive contests without physical interactions like fights. This assumption has rarely been tested for wild mammals. Recent studies of mammals have revealed relationships of vocal attributes to age and body size. Here, we analyse relationships of frequency attributes of agonistic vocalizations to phenotype (age, body size, proboscis size and agonistic behaviour) in males of the southern elephant seal, Mirminga leonina, a species with intense male competition for access to females, and in which vocalizations are used frequently to settle male-male contests. We analysed formant structure and vocal tract size, and found that nasal and oral components of the vocal tract contribute separately to vocal formants; hence, the male's proboscis serves to elongate the vocal tract. We also found that formants in the upper part of the frequency spectrum (fourth and fifth in particular) and formant dispersion convey significant information about age, size and resource holding potential at large, and, therefore, can be honest signals of a vocalizer's phenotype. Explained variance was statistically significant in our study and in similar studies but was not high, so formant structure cannot serve as the sole basis of acoustic assessment. Other possible sources of information exchanged in elephant seal contests are nonvocal acoustic signals (e.g. vibrations) and optical displays.

abstract = {During the 1995 hunting season, 75 harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) were sampled in three locations in West Greenland: Maniitsoq, Nuuk, and Paamiut. Sex, age, morphometrics, reproductive condition, and organochlorine compound (OC) levels in blubber were determined for each individual. OC levels were extremely low and; therefore considered unlikely to affect the population adversely: mean blubber concentrations, expressed on lipid weight basis were 1.98 (S.D. =1.1) mg/kg for PCBs, 2.76 (S.D.=1.66) mg/kg for tDDT and 0.21 (S.D.=0.11) mg/kg for HCB. No statistical differences were observed among individuals caught in the various locations. OC concentrations showed statistically significant positive associations with age in males but negative in females; consequently, mature females presented lower pollutant loads than their male counterparts. Juveniles did not show differences between sexes. A higher proportion of less chlorinated and more metabolizable polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) compared to tPCBs was found in calves (age {\textless} =1) than in mature females, indicating that the feeding habits of these two groups differ and that a greater transfer of less chlorinated compounds is passed from females to their pups through lactation and parturition. Harbour porpoises significantly contribute to the dietary intake of OCs by local Inuit populations. This contribution could be reduced if mature males were selectively avoided; however, current hunting procedures make this selection impracticable. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Goals of the review were to evaluate the state of knowledge of bycatch and the role of existing protective legislation in shaping bycatch management for different taxa. Pressing issues are identified, as well as knowledge gaps and policy limitations that hinder multi-species bycatch reduction. The USA has made important progress toward reducing bycatch in its fisheries, but the efficacy of its management has been limited somewhat by a focus on taxon- and fishery-specific regulation and the lack of consistent mandate across taxa for taking a cumulative perspective on bycatch. Applying consistent criteria across taxa for setting bycatch limits (e.g., extending the approach used for marine mammals to sea turtles and seabirds) would be the first step in a multi-species approach to bycatch reduction. A population-based multi-species multi-gear approach to bycatch would help identify priority areas where resources are needed most and can be used most effectively.},

abstract = {Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses on the function of the humpback whale song are: (1) it attracts females to the male singer; (2) it is a male-male display, that may order status. To evaluate these, from 24 January-13 April 1997 off Maui, Hawaii, 42 singers were located, audio-recorded, photo-identified and monitored for interactions with other whales. Whales that joined singers were biopsy sampled for molecular determination of sex. In 76{\%} (32 of 42) of the interactions, a lone non-singing adult joined the singer. In the remainder, singers stopped singing and joined a nearby group or accompanied other whales. In 81{\%} (26 of 32) instances where a lone adult joined a singer, the pair split again within minutes; otherwise a group formed. In one such group the pair became a trio and eventually joined a competitive group. Behavior in joining/splitting interactions ranged from a single pass-by, to surface activity such as tail lobs and breaches. The sex of 22 joiners was determined: 14 genetically and eight behaviorally. All were males. Humpback whale song preceded, and at times followed, male-male interactions of variable duration and agonistic level in and around the breeding season. If considered within the context of a proposed dominance polygyny mating system, these observations appear to support speculation that the song may function in male social ordering.},

abstract = {Using suction-cup attached time-depth recorder/VHF radio tags, we have obtained the first diving data on northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus), the first such data on any species within the family Ziphiidae. Two deployments in 1997 on northern bottlenose whales in a submarine canyon off Nova Scotia demonstrated their exceptional diving ability, with dives approximately every 80 min to over 800 m (maximum 1453 m), and up to 70 min in duration. Sonar traces of non-tagged, diving bottlenose whales in 1996 and 1997 suggest that such deep dives are not unusual. This combined evidence leads us to hypothesize that these whales may make greater use of deep portions of the water column than any other mammal so far studied. Many of the recorded dives of the tagged animals were to, or close to, the sea floor, consistent with benthic or bathypelagic foraging. A lack of correlation between dive times and surface intervals suggests that the dives were predominately aerobic.},

Although fiercely defended by workers, ant societies are infiltrated by specialist insects that exploit their resources. Sounds produced by pupae and larvae of the parasitic butterfly Maculinea rebeli mimic those of queen ants more closely than those of workers, enabling them to achieve high status within ant societies. We conclude that acoustical mimicry provides another route for infiltration for approximately 10,000 species of social parasites that cheat ant societies.},

abstract = {A time-frequency contour extraction and classification algorithm was created to analyze humpback whale vocalizations. The algorithm automatically extracted contours of whale vocalization units by searching for gray-level discontinuities in the spectrogram images. The unit-to-unit similarity was quantified by cross-correlating the contour lines. A library of distinctive humpback units was then generated by applying an unsupervised, cluster-based learning algorithm. The purpose of this study was to provide a fast and automated feature selection tool to describe the vocal signatures of animal groups. This approach could benefit a variety of applications such as species description, identification, and evolution of song structures. The algorithm was tested on humpback whale song data recorded at various locations in Hawaii from 2002 to 2003. Results presented in this paper showed low probability of false alarm (0{\%}-4{\%}) under noisy environments with small boat vessels and snapping shrimp. The classification algorithm was tested on a controlled set of 30 units forming six unit types, and all the units were correctly classified. In a case study on humpback data collected in the Auau Chanel, Hawaii, in 2002, the algorithm extracted 951 units, which were classified into 12 distinctive types.},

abstract = {Around 1000 species of bats in the world use echolocation to navigate, orient, and detect insect prey. Many of these bats emerge from their roost at dusk and start foraging when there is still light available. It is however unclear in what way and to which extent navigation, or even prey detection in these bats is aided by vision. Here we compare the echolocation and visual detection ranges of two such species of bats which rely on different foraging strategies (Rhinopoma microphyllum and Pipistrellus kuhlii). We find that echolocation is better than vision for detecting small insects even in intermediate light levels (1-10 lux), while vision is advantageous for monitoring far-away landscape elements in both species. We thus hypothesize that, bats constantly integrate information acquired by the two sensory modalities. We suggest that during evolution, echolocation was refined to detect increasingly small targets in conjunction with using vision. To do so, the ability to hear ultrasonic sound is a prerequisite which was readily available in small mammals, but absent in many other animal groups. The ability to exploit ultrasound to detect very small targets, such as insects, has opened up a large nocturnal niche to bats and may have spurred diversification in both echolocation and foraging tactics.},

abstract = {The effect of seismic discharges on rock lobsters was investigated through statistical analysis of the coincidence between seismic surveys and changes in commercial catch rates in western Victoria between 1978 and 2004. In 12 depth-stratified regions, the number of acoustic pulses during seismic surveys was correlated with catch per unit effort (CPUE) of rock lobsters to determine whether catch rates were affected in the years following seismic surveys. In three regions subject to intensive seismic surveys two-way analysis of variance was used to detect short-term (weekly) changes in CPUE before, during and after these seismic surveys. There was no evidence that catch rates of rock lobsters in western Victoria were affected by seismic surveys in the weeks or years following the surveys. However, most seismic surveys occurred in deep water, where impacts would be expected to be minimal. The sensitivity of analyses in shallow water was generally limited by low levels of seismic surveying, but in one region where there was intensive seismic activity, the sensitivity was limited by the low abundance of rock lobsters. The apparent lack of impact of seismic surveys on catch rates of rock lobsters is consistent with the limited information available on the physiological effects of seismic surveys on invertebrates, including rock lobsters.},

abstract = {The site and physiologic mechanism(s) responsible for the generation of odontocete biosonar signals have eluded investigators for decades. To address these issues we subjected postmortem toothed whale heads to interrogation using medical imaging techniques. Most of the 40 specimens (from 19 species) were examined using X-ray computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MR). Interpretation of scan images was aided by subsequent dissection of the specimens or, in one case, by cryosectioning. In all specimens we described a similar tissue complex and identified it as the hypothetical biosonar signal generator. This complex includes a small pair of fatty bursae embedded in a pair of connective tissue lips, a cartilaginous blade, a stout ligament, and an array of soft tissue air sacs. Comparing and contrasting the morphologic patterns of nasal structures across species representing every extant odontocete superfamily reveals probable homologous relationships, which suggests that all toothed whales may be making their biosonar signals by a similar mechanism. {\textcopyright} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The capability of breathing and clicking at the same time is unique among studied odontocetes and relates to the extreme asymmetry of the sperm whale sound-producing forehead.

Killer whales (Orcinus orca) can be potential predators of many other cetaceans, and the interception of their vocalizations by unintended cetacean receivers may trigger anti-predator behavior that could mediate predator-prey interactions. We explored the anti-predator behaviour of five typically-solitary male sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in the Norwegian Sea by playing sounds of mammal-feeding killer whales and monitoring behavioural responses using multi-sensor tags. Our results suggest that, rather than taking advantage of their large aerobic capacities to dive away from the perceived predator, sperm whales responded to killer whale playbacks by interrupting their foraging or resting dives and returning to the surface, changing their vocal production, and initiating a surprising degree of social behaviour in these mostly solitary animals. Thus, the interception of predator vocalizations by male sperm whales disrupted functional behaviours and mediated previously unrecognized anti-predator responses.},

It is computationally efficient thanks to the use of dynamic programming and can also be applied when the number of change-points is unknown.

In reality, however, social cooperation can also arise spontaneously, based on local interactions rather than centralized control. The self-organization of cooperative behavior is particularly puzzling for social dilemmas related to sharing natural resources or creating common goods. Such situations are often described by the prisoner's dilemma. Here, we report the sudden outbreak of predominant cooperation in a noisy world dominated by selfishness and defection, when individuals imitate superior strategies and show success-driven migration. In our model, individuals are unrelated, and do not inherit behavioral traits. They defect or cooperate selfishly when the opportunity arises, and they do not know how often they will interact or have interacted with someone else. Moreover, our individuals have no reputation mechanism to form friendship networks, nor do they have the option of voluntary interaction or costly punishment. Therefore, the outbreak of prevailing cooperation, when directed motion is integrated in a game-theoretical model, is remarkable, particularly when random strategy mutations and random relocations challenge the formation and survival of cooperative clusters. Our results suggest that mobility is significant for the evolution of social order, and essential for its stabilization and maintenance.},

abstract = {The mechanism of mysticete (baleen whale) vocalization has remained a mystery. Vocal folds (true vocal ldquocordsrdquo), the structures responsible for sound production in terrestrial mammals, were thought to be absent in whales. This study tests the hypothesis that the mysticete larynx possesses structures homologous to vocal folds and that they are capable of sound generation. Laryngeal anatomy was examined in 37 specimens representing 6 mysticete species. Results indicate the presence of a U-shaped fold (U-fold) in the lumen of the larynx. The U-fold is supported by arytenoid cartilages, controlled by skeletal muscles innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve, is adjacent to a diverticulum (laryngeal sac) covered with mucosa innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve, and contains a ligament - conditions that also define the vocal folds of terrestrial mammals and, therefore, supports homology. Unlike the vocal folds of terrestrial mammals, which are perpendicular to airflow, the mysticete U-fold is oriented parallel to airflow. U-fold adduction/abduction and elevation/depression may control airflow, and vibration of its edges may generate sounds. The walls of the laryngeal sac can expand and contract, may serve as a resonant space, and may also propagate vibrations generated by movements of the supporting arytenoid cartilages. The extensive musculature surrounding the laryngeal sac may enable rapid and forceful expulsion of air from the lumen of the sac into other respiratory spaces, or maintain a constant sac volume despite the effects of ambient pressure (e.g., changes during diving or ascent). The size and complexity of the mysticete larynx indicates an organ with multiple functions, including protection during breathing/swallowing, regulation of airflow and pressures in the respiratory spaces, and sound generation. The presence of a vocal fold homolog offers a new insight into both the mechanism of sound generation by mysticetes and the divergent evolution of odontocete and mysticete cetaceans.

abstract = {Interactions between large marine predators and their prey are difficult to observe and little is known about the risk of predation faced by sea turtles. The frequency of predator-inflicted injuries, however, has afforded insights into the predation risk faced by many taxa. We measured the frequency of shark-inflicted injuries on green (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtles in Shark Bay, Western Australia with a view to determining differences between species and sex-classes in the risk of predation from tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier). Furthermore, we investigated how escape ability and habitat use might influence the probability of turtles being injured by sharks. Shark-inflicted injuries were more frequent on loggerhead than on green turtles, and most frequent on adult male loggerhead turtles. Species effects could not be attributed to differences in habitat use, since green turtles were found in habitats favored by tiger sharks more often than were loggerhead turtles. Green turtles, however, were faster and maneuvered better than loggerhead turtles, suggesting that escape ability is a factor in interspecific differences in injury frequency. The sex-class difference in injury frequency of loggerhead turtles suggests that males face greater predation risk than females and may take more risks. For green turtles, the lack of a sex difference in injury frequency might be due to greater escape ability lowering overall predation risk or to no differences between sexes in the benefits of risk-taking.},

abstract = {Ecological constraints often shape the echolocation pulses emitted by bat species. Consequently some (but not all) bats emit species-specific echolocation pulses. Because echolocation pulses are often intense and emitted at high rates, they are potential targets for eavesdropping by other bats. Echolocation pulses can also vary within species according to sex, body size, age, social group and geographic location. Whether these features can be recognised by other bats can only be determined reliably by playback experiments, which have shown that echolocation pulses do provide sufficient information for the identification of sex and individual in one species. Playbacks also show that bats can locate conspecifics and heterospecifics at foraging and roost sites by eavesdropping on echolocation pulses. Guilds of echolocating bat species often partition their use of pulse frequencies. Ecology, allometric scaling and phylogeny play roles here, but are not sufficient to explain this partitioning. Evidence is accumulating to support the hypothesis that frequency partitioning evolved to facilitate intraspecific communication. Acoustic character displacement occurs in at least one instance. Future research can relate genetic population structure to regional variation in echolocation pulse features and elucidate those acoustic features that most contribute to discrimination of individuals.},

abstract = {The distance at which active naval sonar signals can be heard by harbor porpoises depends, among other factors, on the hearing thresholds of the species for those signals. Therefore the hearing sensitivity of a harbor porpoise was determined for 1 s up-sweep and down-sweep signals, mimicking mid-frequency and low-frequency active sonar sweeps (MFAS, 6-7 kHz band; LFAS, 1-2 kHz band). The 1-2 kHz sweeps were also tested with harmonics, as sonars sometimes produce these as byproducts of the fundamental signal. The hearing thresholds for up-sweeps and down-sweeps within each sweep pair were similar. The 50{\%} detection threshold sound pressure levels (broadband, averaged over the signal duration) of the 1-2 kHz and 6-7 kHz sweeps were 75 and 67 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa(2), respectively. Harmonic deformation of the 1-2 kHz sweeps reduced the threshold to 59 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa(2). This study shows that the presence of harmonics in sonar signals can increase the detectability of a signal by harbor porpoises, and that tonal audiograms may not accurately predict the audibility of sweeps. LFAS systems, when designed to produce signals without harmonics, can operate at higher source levels than MFAS systems, at similar audibility distances for porpoises.},

Specifically, we show that (i) short-term changes in state influence contributions to a cooperative behaviour, (ii) individuals communicate short-term changes in state, and (iii) individuals use information about the state of group mates to adjust their own investment in sentinel behaviour. Our results demonstrate that individual decisions about contributions to a cooperative effort can be influenced by information about the likely future contribution of others. We suggest that similar pre-emptive adjustments based on information obtained from collaborators will be a common feature of cooperative behaviour, and may play an important role in the development of complex communication in social species.},

abstract = {Geographic variation of vocal behaviour may be reflective of genetic, cultural and ecological differences between locations. Such differences have been previously reported in six pinnipeds, including Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii). This study investigated whether the acoustic characteristics of airborne Weddell seal mother and pup 'Cycontact' calls vary geographically between the Vestfold Hills and McMurdo Sound. From each location, 72 mother and 120 pup calls were analysed, with 11 acoustic characteristics measured. MANOVA and Discriminant function analysis (DFA) identified significant differences in several fundamental frequency characteristics. The cross-validated DFA classified greater than 60{\%} of mother and pup vocalisations to the correct location. For novel calls, the probabilities of correctly classifying these percentages by chance are low. Additionally, ordinal logistic regression identified significant differences in the maximum energy distribution of mother and pup vocalisations. For pups, this variation is likely the result of genetic differences between the two populations. Nevertheless, results support suggestions that, when compared with underwater repertoire differences, airborne within-call differences are less efficient at identifying Weddell seal breeding populations.},

abstract = {Echolocation is energetically costly for resting bats, but previous experiments suggested echolocation to come at no costs for flying bats. Yet, previous studies did not investigate the relationship between echolocation, flight speed, aerial manoeuvres and metabolism. We re-evaluated the 'no-cost' hypothesis, by quantifying the echolocation pulse rate, the number of aerial manoeuvres (landings and U-turns), and the costs of transport in the 5-g insectivorous bat Rhogeessa io (Vespertilionidae). On average, bats (n = 15) travelled at 1.76 ± 0.36 m s(-1) and performed 11.2 ± 6.1 U-turns and 2.8 ± 2.9 ground landings when flying in an octagonal flight cage. Bats made more U-turns with decreasing wing loading (body weight divided by wing area). At flight, bats emitted 19.7 ± 2.7 echolocation pulses s(-1) (range 15.3-25.8 pulses s(-1)), and metabolic rate averaged 2.84 ± 0.95 ml CO(2) min(-1), which was more than 16 times higher than at rest. Bats did not echolocate while not engaged in flight. Costs of transport were not related to the rate of echolocation pulse emission or the number of U-turns, but increased with increasing number of landings; probably as a consequence of slower travel speed when staying briefly on ground. Metabolic power of flight was lower than predicted for R. io under the assumption that energetic costs of echolocation call production is additive to the aerodynamic costs of flight.

abstract = {Although diving birds and mammals can withstand extended periods under water, field studies show that most perform mainly short, aerobic dives. Theoretical studies of diving have implicitly assumed that prey acquisition increases linearly with time spent searching and have examined strategies that maximize time spent foraging. We present a simple model of diving in seals, where dive durations are influenced by the seal's assessment of patch quality, but are ultimately constrained by oxygen balance. Prey encounters within a dive are assumed to be Poisson distributed and the scale of the patches is such that a predator will encounter a constant prey density during a dive. We investigated the effects of a simple giving-up rule, using recent prey encounter rate to assess patch quality. The model predicts that, for shallow dives, there should always be a net benefit from terminating dives early if no prey are encountered early in the dive. The magnitude of the benefit was highest at low patch densities. The relative gain depended on the magnitude of the travel time and the time taken to assess patch quality and the effect was reduced in deeper dives. As the time taken to decide decreased, the relative benefit increased, up to a maximum, but fell as decision time was reduced further. Frequency distributions of different aspects of dive durations from three deep-diving and two shallow-diving seal species are presented and compared with the model's predictions.

abstract = {We compared the flight and echolocation behaviour of a vespertilionid bat (Myotis nattereri) approaching a large stationary or a small moving target. Bats were trained to either land on a landing grid or to catch a moving tethered mealworm. When closing in on these two targets, the bats emitted groups of sounds with increasing number of signals and decreasing pulse interval and duration. When pursuing the mealworm, the approach phase always ended with a terminal group consisting of buzz I and buzz II. When landing, the bats emitted either a terminal group consisting of buzz I alone, with one or two extra pulses, or a group consisting of buzz I and buzz II. In all situations, buzz I ended on average between 47-63 ms prior to contact with the target of interest, which is approximately the reaction time of bats. Therefore, the information collected in buzz II does not guide the bats to the target. The relevant part of the approach phase to reach the target ends with buzz I. The basic sound pattern of this part is rather similar and independent of whether the bats approach the large stationary or the small moving target.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that pelagic larvae of coral reef fishes are active in their dispersal and return to a reef; however, the mechanisms used to navigate are unknown. Sound is a potentially important cue for organisms in marine environments, especially in noisy environments like coral reefs. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) technique was used to measure hearing of a wide size range of sergeant major damselfish Abudefduf saxatilis. Complete audiograms were measured for 32 fish ranging in size from 11 to 121 mm. Significant effects of standard length on hearing thresholds at 100 and 200 Hz were detected. At these lower frequencies, thresholds increased with an increase in size. All fish were most sensitive to the lower frequencies (100 to 400 Hz). The frequency range over which fish could detect sounds was dependent upon the size of the fish; the larger fish ({\textgreater}50 mm) were more likely to respond to higher frequencies (1000 to 1600 Hz). A. saxatilis has poor hearing sensitivity in comparison to other hearing generalists including other species of pomacentrids. In consideration of the high hearing thresholds found in this study in comparison to recorded ambient reef noise, it is unlikely that sound plays a significant role in the navigation of the pelagic larvae of sergeant majors returning to the reef from long distances ({\textgreater}1 km), but it may play a role in short-range orientation ({\textless}1 km). },

abstract = {The nine crista/cupula sections (C1–C9) that form the angular acceleration receptor system ofOctopus vulgaris can be divided into two subsystems on the basis of cupula size. Electrophysiological recordings were made from representatives (C1 and C2) of these two sub-systems to determine their functional response characteristics.1.With the statocyst stationary in the normal upright position, 62{\%} of the afferent units from erista section C2, which has a large cupula, displayed a resting level of activity. None of the afferent units from erista section C1, which has a small cupula, showed resting activity.2.The dynamic responses of the C1 and C2 units were examined during sinusoidal oscillations of the statocyst in the pitch plane at stimulus frequencies between 0.01 and 1.6 Hz, and with amplitudes between 3° and 35°. Both the C1 and C2 units showed linear increases in their responses with increasing stimulus amplitudes (Fig. 5). The threshold frequency at which a unit first responded was found to be an order of magnitude lower for the C2 units in comparison to the C1 units (Fig. 9). At a stimulus frequency of 1.6 Hz, 40{\%} of the C2 units showed a saturation in their responses. None of the C1 units showed signs of response saturation at this frequency.3.The gain values of the C1 and C2 units decreased with increasing stimulus frequency; the C1 values were higher than the C2 values (Fig. 7). The phase lag values, with respect to peak angular acceleration, were lower for C2 units compared with C1 units (Fig. 8). The phase lag values of both types of unit increased with increasing stimulus frequency but, in the middle frequency range, showed a plateau level at 100° for the C1 units and between 80° and 90° for the C2 units (Fig. 8). This indicates that in the middle frequency range the units code angular velocity. Both phase and gain values were affected by changes in the orientation of the statocyst with respect to gravity (Fig. 12).4.All of the units analysed in this report originated from ventrally polarized receptor cells. However, during large amplitude oscillations, responses from dorsally polarized receptor units were also observed (Fig. 13).5.These results demonstrate that the octopus angular acceleration receptor system is divided into two sub-systems of differing sensitivities and that the dynamic response characteristics of the system show close parallels with those of the vertebrate semicircular canal system.},

abstract = {In South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis) breeding in dense colonies at Punta San Juan, Peru, mothers are regularly separated from pups when they forage at sea throughout lactation and as a result of disturbances among females during on-beach nursing periods. Unattended pups risk injury or death from aggressive females and predatory sea lions, so the ability of mothers and pups to recognize and reunite is an essential component of breeding success. I investigated the relative importance of vocal, visual, olfactory, and spatial cues in the reunion process and examined how these behaviors are related to search context and success. Behavior of 10 tagged mother–pup pairs was recorded during 118 searches, 67{\%} of which resulted in reunion. Mothers and pups appeared to recognize one another by vocal signatures over distance, and mothers used naso-nasal investigation before accepting or rejecting pups. Mothers supplemented their calling behavior with a variety of low-cost strategies such as frequenting a consistent “home spot” (76{\%}), moving about the colony (49{\%}), and investigating approaching pups (42{\%}), but the best predictor of search success was pup response: after pups called and moved toward mothers, pairs were reunited 95{\%} of the time regardless of mothers' behavior. Pups responded infrequently (18{\%}) to the wrong female, suggesting that pups' acceptance criteria are conservative when risk of injury from unrelated females is high.},

abstract = {Mimicry of visual warning signals is one of the keystone concepts in evolutionary biology and has received substantial research attention. By comparison, acoustic mimicry has never been rigorously tested. Visualizing bat-moth interactions with high-speed, infrared videography, we provide empirical evidence for acoustic mimicry in the ultrasonic warning sounds that tiger moths produce in response to echolocating bats. Two species of sound-producing tiger moths were offered successively to naive, free-flying red and big brown bats. Noctuid and pyralid moth controls were also offered each night. All bats quickly learned to avoid the noxious tiger moths first offered to them, associating the warning sounds with bad taste. They then avoided the second sound-producing species regardless of whether it was chemically protected or not, verifying both Mullerian and Batesian mimicry in the acoustic modality. A subset of the red bats subsequently discovered the palatability of the Batesian mimic, demonstrating the powerful selective force these predators exert on mimetic resemblance. Given these results and the widespread presence of tiger moth species and other sound-producing insects that respond with ultrasonic clicks to bat attack, acoustic mimicry complexes are likely common components of the acoustic landscape.},

abstract = {Assessments of the impact of offshore energy developments are constrained because it is not known whether fine-scale behavioural responses to noise lead to broader-scale displacement of protected small cetaceans. We used passive acoustic monitoring and digital aerial surveys to study changes in the occurrence of harbour porpoises across a 2000 km(2) study area during a commercial two-dimensional seismic survey in the North Sea. Acoustic and visual data provided evidence of group responses to airgun noise from the 470 cu inch array over ranges of 5-10 km, at received peak-to-peak sound pressure levels of 165-172 dB re 1 µPa and sound exposure levels (SELs) of 145-151 dB re 1 µPa(2) s(-1). However, animals were typically detected again at affected sites within a few hours, and the level of response declined through the 10 day survey. Overall, acoustic detections decreased significantly during the survey period in the impact area compared with a control area, but this effect was small in relation to natural variation. These results demonstrate that prolonged seismic survey noise did not lead to broader-scale displacement into suboptimal or higher-risk habitats, and suggest that impact assessments should focus on sublethal effects resulting from changes in foraging performance of animals within affected sites.},

The aim of this study is to analyse the inter-individual association patterns within this pilot whales community to (1) provide an insight on their long-term social system and (2) to assess the relationship between sexes within this social system. Between 1999 and 2006, 23,004 km was sampled in the Strait of Gibraltar, and 4,887 images of dorsal fins of pilot whales were taken from 226 groups. The sex of 56 of the individuals could be determined genetically. The strength of the behavioural relationships between dyads of individuals was calculated, and the temporal aspects of the social structure were evaluated, showing in a non-random social structure made by constant companions. The preferred associations between individuals consisted in associations of males-females. Eight long-term units could be found with different degrees of association rates. Consequently, we propose that, in the Strait, the pilot whales exhibit a hierarchical social system composed of a population encompassing several clans of pilot whales each containing several pods. Pods will then be formed by several line units, similar to killer whale matrilineal units.},

As part of the survey, 145 DIFAR sonobuoys were deployed every 30' of latitude on north-south transects, and prior to CTD stations on the initial east-west transect. Underwater sound was analyzed for 70 minute samples from each sonobuoy. Blue whales were the most commonly recorded species, identified at 55 of the sonobuoy deployment sites. Other species recorded include: sperm (46 sites), fin (14), humpback (2), and sei (3) whales, and leopard (11) and Ross (17) seals. Large numbers of blue and sperm whales, and all Ross seals were detected on the westernmost two transects, which were the only transects of the survey with relatively extensive sea ice remaining off the continental shelf. Large numbers of blue whales were also detected in the more eastern waters of the survey off the Prydz Bay region, while two detections of pygmy blue whales represent the farthest south these whales have been recorded. Of the relatively few fin whale detections, most occurred in more northerly waters. Fin whale vocalizations from this region were distinctly different than those recorded elsewhere around Antarctica suggesting acoustic recordings may be useful to delineate regional or stock boundaries of this species. Previously undescribed sounds were attributed to Ross seals. Acoustic detections of these and leopard seal sounds indicate these animals venture further from their traditionally described distributions, with vocalizing leopard seals occurring much further north than might be expected.

abstract = {Recently, there have been an increasing number of studies using change-point methods to detect artificial or natural discontinuities and regime shifts in climate. However, a major drawback with most of the currently used change-point methods is the lack of flexibility (able to detect one specific type of shift under the assumption that the residuals are independent). As temporal variations in climate are complex, it may be difficult to identify change points with very simple models. Moreover, climate time series are known to exhibit autocorrelation, which corresponds to a model misspecification if not taken into account and can lead to the detection of non-existent shifts. In this study, we extend a method known as the informational approach for change-point detection to take into account the presence of autocorrelation in the model. The usefulness and flexibility of this approach are demonstrated through applications. Furthermore, it is highly desirable to develop techniques that can detect shifts soon after they occur for climate monitoring. To address this, we also carried out a simulation study in order to investigate the number of years after which an abrupt shift is detectable. We use two decision rules in order to decide whether a shift is detected or not, which represents a trade-off between increasing our chances of detecting a shift and reducing the risk of detecting a shift while in reality there is none. We show that, as of now, we have good chances to detect an abrupt shift with a magnitude that is larger than that of the standard deviation in the series of observations. For shifts with a very large magnitude (three times the standard deviation), our simulation study shows that after only 4 years the probabilities of shift detection reach nearly 100 per cent. This reveals that the approach has potential for climate monitoring.},

abstract = {We conducted playback experiments with wild bottlenose dolphins,Tursiops truncatus, to determine whether there is sufficient information in their individually distinctive signature whistles for individual recognition. We conducted experiments with members of a resident community of dolphins in waters near Sarasota, Florida, during temporary capture-release projects. We used a paired playback design, wherein the same two whistle sequences were predicted to evoke opposite responses from two different target animals. This design controlled for any unknown cues that may have been present in the playback stimuli. We predicted that mothers would respond more strongly to the whistles of their own independent offspring than to the whistles of a familiar, similar-aged nonoffspring. Similarly, we predicted that independent offspring would respond more strongly to the whistles of their own mother than to the whistles of a familiar, similar-aged female. Target animals were significantly (P{\textless}0.02) more likely to respond to the predicted stimuli, with responses measured by the number of head turns towards the playback speaker. In bottlenose dolphin societies, stable, individual-specific relationships are intermixed with fluid patterns of association between individuals. In primate species that live in similar [`]fission-fusion' type societies, individual recognition is commonplace. Thus, when taken in the context of what is known about the social structure and behaviour of bottlenose dolphins, these playback experiments suggest that signature whistles are used for individual recognition.},

abstract = {Dynamic body acceleration (DBA) has been used as a proxy for energy expenditure in logger-equipped animals, with researchers summing the acceleration (overall dynamic body acceleration--ODBA) from the three orthogonal axes of devices. The vector of the dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) may be a better proxy so this study compared ODBA and VeDBA as proxies for rate of oxygen consumption using humans and 6 other species. Twenty-one humans on a treadmill ran at different speeds while equipped with two loggers, one in a straight orientation and the other skewed, while rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) was recorded. Similar data were obtained from animals but using only one (straight) logger. In humans, both ODBA and VeDBA were good proxies for VO2 with all r(2) values exceeding 0.88, although ODBA accounted for slightly but significantly more of the variation in VO2 than did VeDBA (P{\textless}0.03). There were no significant differences between ODBA and VeDBA in terms of the change in VO2 estimated by the acceleration data in a simulated situation of the logger being mounted straight but then becoming skewed (P = 0.744). In the animal study, ODBA and VeDBA were again good proxies for VO2 with all r(2) values exceeding 0.70 although, again, ODBA accounted for slightly, but significantly, more of the variation in VO2 than did VeDBA (P{\textless}0.03). The simultaneous contraction of muscles, inserted variously for limb stability, may produce muscle oxygen use that at least partially equates with summing components to derive DBA. Thus, a vectorial summation to derive DBA cannot be assumed to be the more 'correct' calculation. However, although within the limitations of our simple study, ODBA appears a marginally better proxy for VO2. In the unusual situation where researchers are unable to guarantee at least reasonably consistent device orientation, they should use VeDBA as a proxy for VO2.},

abstract = {Rats incorporate circa 22 kHz ultrasonic alarm cries into their defense pattern in response to a predator threat. These calls are dependent on conspecific presence, show gender differences, and tend to be emitted from a place of relative safety. Rats emit sonic defensive threat vocalizations when approached by a potential threat. These are emitted regardless of conspecific presence, and increase as a function of threat proximity, eventually culminating in defensive attack at close distances. Ample data from field studies suggest a similar division of vocalizations into alarm or warning cries, and defensive threat vocalizations, although both are often subsumed under the rubric of "alarm cries". A clear distinction between these types of calls is necessary for proper analysis of the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the development and maintenance of each of them. Furthermore, the integration of data from field studies and laboratory experiments may prove useful in evaluation of the relationship between each type of cry and emotional (fear or anxiety-like) states in mammals.},

Dolphin presence and distribution was assessed by a system of percentage acoustic contact. Results were compared with those from a seismic/dolphin survey during the same months of the previous year, and across the same survey area. Distributions of common dolphins within the survey area showed similar trends for both years, with a marked decrease in dolphin contacts between September and October of both years. These observations suggest offshore migration of common dolphin populations at the time of year. Sea surface temperature distribution across the entire region was visualized during two survey periods using infrared satellite imagery. It is hypothesized from these observations that offshore migration of common dolphins coincides with a break-up of the Celtic Sea Front, a distinct oceanographic feature which crosses the survey area.},

abstract = {Odontocetes (toothed whales) vocalize for communication and echolocation. The mechanisms of sound production, however, remain unclear. Their larynx has long been thought to lack vocal folds and, thus, was considered incapable of generating sounds. This study investigates internal anatomy of the odontocete larynx to: 1) describe the morphology of any fold found, 2) determine any structural homologies between these folds and the vocal folds of terrestrial mammals, and 3) assess their possible function in sound production. Larynges of 24 odontocetes representin ten genera (Delphinus, Stenella, Lagenorhynchus, Tursiops, Grampus, Delphinapterus, Globicephala, Kogia, Mesoplodon, and Phocoena) were studied post mortem. Nine specimens were cut midsagittally, and the remainder were dorsally opened to reveal internal anatomy. Results show that, contrary to established belief, vocal folds are consistently present. They are not isolated bands or ldquocordsrdquo but appear continuous with the internal laryngeal membrane. The attachments of these folds are the same as in terrestrial mammals, thus indicating homology with true mammalian vocal folds. These folds extend from the midline of the thyroid cartilage to the base of the arytenoid cartilages, sometimes to a discrete process. The vocal folds are elongated and oriented in a vertical plane, parallel to airflow direction. Vocal fold morphology varies, appearing as true bifurcated structures, a trifurcated fold, or a single midline fold. Laryngeal ventricles and vestibular folds are also consistently found lateral to the vocal folds. The vocal folds may divide the airstream within the into three separate air currents. Fold vibrations may produce initial laryngeal sounds used in echolocation or communication.},

Two bow-riding white-beaked dolphins Lagenorhynchus albirostris (a female and a male) were captured using the hoop-net technique in Faxafloi Bay, Iceland. The dolphins were transferred to a stretcher and hoisted into a plastic research tank on board a small fishing vessel. Two underwater transducers were used to cover the frequency range from 16 to 215 kHz. Two human EEG electrodes mounted in suction cups, one placed near the blow hole and the other on the dorsal fin, picked up bioelectrical responses to acoustic stimuli. Responses to about 1000 sinusoidal amplitude modulated stimuli for each amplitude/frequency combination were averaged and analyzed using a fast Fourier transform to obtain an evoked auditory response. Threshold was defined as the zero crossing of the response using linear regression. Two threshold frequencies at 50 kHz and 64 kHz were obtained from the female. An audiogram ranging from 16 to 181 kHz was obtained from an adult male and showed the typical. 'U' shaped curve for odontocetes. The thresholds for both white-beaks were comparable and demonstrated the most sensitive high frequency hearing of any known dolphin and were as sensitive as the harbor porpoise.},

abstract = {Spatial coherence between predators and prey has rarely been observed in pelagic marine ecosystems. We used measures of the environment, prey abundance, prey quality, and prey distribution to explain the observed distributions of three co-occurring predator species breeding on islands in the southeastern Bering Sea: black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), and northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus). Predictions of statistical models were tested using movement patterns obtained from satellite-tracked individual animals. With the most commonly used measures to quantify prey distributions--areal biomass, density, and numerical abundance--we were unable to find a spatial relationship between predators and their prey. We instead found that habitat use by all three predators was predicted most strongly by prey patch characteristics such as depth and local density within spatial aggregations. Additional prey patch characteristics and physical habitat also contributed significantly to characterizing predator patterns. Our results indicate that the small-scale prey patch characteristics are critical to how predators perceive the quality of their food supply and the mechanisms they use to exploit it, regardless of time of day, sampling year, or source colony. The three focal predator species had different constraints and employed different foraging strategies--a shallow diver that makes trips of moderate distance (kittiwakes), a deep diver that makes trip of short distances (murres), and a deep diver that makes extensive trips (fur seals). However, all three were similarly linked by patchiness of prey rather than by the distribution of overall biomass. This supports the hypothesis that patchiness may be critical for understanding predator-prey relationships in pelagic marine systems more generally.},

@article{Dubrovsky2004,
abstract = {Abstract  A physical and a mathematical models of the dolphin's source of echolocation clicks have been recently proposed. The physical model includes a bottle of pressurized air connected to the atmosphere with an underwater rubber tube. A compressing rubber ring is placed on the underwater portion of the tube. The ring blocks the air jet passing through the tube from the bottle. This ring can be brought into self-oscillation by the air jet. In the simplest case, the ring displacement follows a repeated triangular waveform. Because the acoustic pressure gradient is proportional to the second time derivative of the displacement, clicks arise at the bends of the displacement waveform. The mathematical model describes the dipole oscillations of a sphere “frozen” in the ring and calculates the waveform and the sound pressure of the generated clicks. The critical parameters of the mathematical model are the radius of the sphere and the peak value and duration of the triangular displacement curve. This model allows one to solve both the forward (deriving the properties of acoustic clicks from the known source parameters) and the inverse (calculating the source parameters from the acoustic data) problems. Data from click records of Odontocetes were used to derive both the displacement waveforms and the size of the “frozen sphere” or a structure functionally similar to it. The mathematical model predicts a maximum source level of up to 235 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa at 1-m range when using a 5-cm radius of the “frozen” sphere and a 4-mm maximal displacement. The predicted sound pressure level is similar to that of the clicks produced by Odontocetest.},

abstract = {1. Assessing the number of animals in a population is a fundamental requirement for effective wildlife management. Determining this information for cetaceans can be logistically difficult, and the abundance of inshore cetaceans along most of the world's coastline is unknown. 2. In this study we illustrate the potential of using sound as a tool for estimating the abundance of inshore cetaceans, using Pacific humpback dolphins Sousa chinensis. 3. Acoustic recordings of humpback dolphins were made in conjunction with visual observations of school size from a land-based platform on Stradbroke Island, Australia. 4. The mean number of calls recorded per 3-min sample period was regressed against the number of dolphins observed using schools for which more than three sample periods were recorded. The relationship estimated number of dolphins = 2{\^{A}}{\textperiodcentered}39 {\~{A}}— the mean number of calls per 3-min sample was used to estimate the number of dolphins in schools for which fewer than four samples were recorded. Comparing these results against known group sizes indicated that this estimation technique is acceptable. 5. Recordings could be made using remotely deployed hydrophone units or submerged autonomous units to provide information on the occurrence and group size of inshore delphinids within an area. 6. Inexperienced personnel could deploy and retrieve recording units. Analysis would require training to recognize sound types from different species, or computer-based sound recognition programs. 7. We conclude that simple techniques using phonations can provide estimates of relative abundance for one species of inshore cetacean. The technique is acceptable for groups of fewer than nine individuals and should be developed to assess its usefulness for studying other species.},

The effect of each sound was judged by comparing the animals' behavior during a 15-min test period with that during a 15-min baseline period immediately before the test and a 15-min recovery period immediately after the test. The effects of the alarms were quantified as the distance between the porpoises' surfacings and the alarm and the animals' respiration rates. Each alarm was tested in two positions in the pen. The behavior observed was related to the sound-pressure-level distribution in the pen. All three alarms: the standard Dukane alarm (a commercially available alarm with a regular pulse interval of 4.3 sec used to deter dolphins from fishing nets), the random Dukane alarm (the same alarm with random pulse interval of between 2 and 30 sec), and the "bird alarm" (a sound from a generator) resulted im increases in both the distance of the animals' surfacings from the alarms and their respiration rates. The standard Dukane alarm and the bird alarm were more effective than the random Dukane alarm in inducing the animals to swim away from the sound source.},

Bayesian methods, including the Bayesian information criterion, are also mentioned in the context of the framework outlined in the paper. The ideas are illustrated using an example in which observations are available for the entire population of interest. This enables us to examine and to measure effects that are usually invisible, because in practical applications only a sample from the population is observed.

abstract = {Bats use echolocation or biosonar to navigate and find prey at night. They emit short ultrasonic calls and listen for reflected echoes. The beam width of the calls is central to the function of the sonar, but directionality of echolocation calls has never been measured from bats flying in the wild. We used a microphone array to record sounds and determine horizontal directionality for echolocation calls of the trawling Daubenton's bat, Myotis daubentonii, flying over a pond in its natural habitat. Myotis daubentonii emitted highly directional calls in the field. Directionality increased with frequency. At 40kHz half-amplitude angle was 25°, decreasing to 14° at 75kHz. In the laboratory, M. daubentonii emitted less intense and less directional calls. At 55kHz half-amplitude angle was 40° in the laboratory versus 20° in the field. The relationship between frequency and directionality can be explained by the simple piston model. The model also suggests that the increase in the emitted intensity in the field is caused by the increased directionality, focusing sound energy in the forward direction. The bat may increase directionality by opening the mouth wider to emit a louder, narrower beam in the wild.},

To study the mating patterns of harbour seals, Phoca vitulina, VHF telemetry was used to relate the distribution and behaviour of adult males to the distribution of females during the summer pupping and mating season. Prior to July males occupied large and variable ranges. At the beginning of July, males decreased their mean range size, but continued to spend much of their time in the water where they made characteristic short dives. Acoustic recordings in the presence of several radiotagged males suggested that these short dives were associated with underwater vocal displays. Throughout July, males varied in the geographical areas which they used to perform these displays. Some individuals were found in the water around haul-out sites; others were located on foraging grounds, up to 50 km from pupping sites, and some were consistently located displaying on transit routes between these two areas. This study supports previous suggestions that vocalizations and diving displays may be associated with male mating behaviour, but suggests that males may display over a much wider geographical area than was previously recognized. This system of dispersed but small display territories is suggestive of lekking. However, further research on the distribution of the clumping of displaying males is required to confirm this.

abstract = {Ships and wind turbines generate noise, which can have a negative impact on marine mammal populations by scaring animals away. Effective modelling of how this affects the populations has to take account of the location and timing of disturbances. Here we construct an individual-based model of harbour porpoises in the Inner Danish Waters. Individuals have their own energy budgets constructed using established principles of physiological ecology. Data are lacking on the spatial distribution of food which is instead inferred from knowledge of time-varying porpoise distributions. The model produces plausible patterns of population dynamics and matches well the age distribution of porpoises caught in by-catch. It estimates the effect of existing wind farms as a 10{\%} reduction in population size when food recovers fast (after two days). Proposed new wind farms and ships do not result in further population declines. The population is however sensitive to variations in mortality resulting from by-catch and to the speed at which food recovers after being depleted. If food recovers slowly the effect of wind turbines becomes negligible, whereas ships are estimated to have a significant negative impact on the population. Annual by-catch rates ≥10{\%} lead to monotonously decreasing populations and to extinction, and even the estimated by-catch rate from the adjacent area (approximately 4.1{\%}) has a strong impact on the population. This suggests that conservation efforts should be more focused on reducing by-catch in commercial gillnet fisheries than on limiting the amount of anthropogenic noise. Individual-based models are unique in their ability to take account of the location and timing of disturbances and to show their likely effects on populations. The models also identify deficiencies in the existing database and can be used to set priorities for future field research.},

abstract = {Many territorial species have the ability to recognise neighbours from stranger individuals. If the neighbouring individual is assumed to pose less of a threat, the territorial individual responds less and avoids unnecessary confrontations with familiar individuals at established boundaries, thus avoiding the costly energy expenditure associated with fighting. Territorial male Australian fur seals respond more to strangers than to neighbouring males. The present study evaluated which acoustic features were important in the neighbour-stranger recognition process in male Australian fur seals. The results reveal that there was an increase in response strength or intensity from males when they heard more bark units, indicating the importance of repetition to detect a caller. However, lengthening and shortening the inter-unit spaces, (i.e. changing the rhythm of the call) did not appear to significantly affect an animal's response. In addition, the whole frequency spectrum was considered important to recognition with results suggesting that they may vary in their importance. A call containing the dominant and surrounding harmonics was considered important to a male's ability to recognise its neighbour. Furthermore, recognition occurs even with a partial bark, but males need to hear between 25 and 75{\%} of each bark unit from neighbouring seals. Our study highlights which acoustic features induce stronger or weaker responses from territorial males, decoding the important features in neighbour-stranger recognition. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We examine the contexts and patterns of “signature” whistle production by wild bottlenose dolphin mother-infant pairs (Tursiops spp.) to gain insight into the functional significance of whistles. Results are based on focal observations and simultaneous recordings of underwater vocalizations. Whistles occur primarily when mother-infant pairs are separated, and the probability of whistles increases with distance of separation. The timing of whistles during separations varies, but whistles tend to be produced in repetitive series and are generally concentrated toward the later stages of the separation, i.e., during the process of reunion. Although we focused on infants, mothers do not appear to whistle during separations as frequently as infants. Infant whistles may function to facilitate reunions by conveying information to the mother concerning the infant's motivation to reunite and/or its location. Infant whistles could induce a cooperative response from the mother including approach, slowing to allow the infant to catch up or whistling. Highly individualized signature whistles may be particularly useful in a fission-fusion society in which individuals (mothers and infants as well as adults) join and leave temporary parties in a fluid manner, yet maintain consistent, long-term associations with particular individuals.},

More than 20 000 tracks were analysed in terms of velocity changes in vertical, athwarthship, and alongship direction relative to the vessel, the warps, and the trawl, respectively. The fish starts diving about 15 min before vessel passing. This coincides with the time the trawl is running and not with the gradual increase in vessel noise caused by the approaching vessel. The change in horizontal movement is more gradual and is directed away from the vessel in the alongship direction, but towards the vessel in the athwarthship direction. The strongest and sharpest response is related to the trawl warps. A strong herding in front of the warps is seen. Closer to the bottom, an athwarthship herding reaction is seen away from the trawl doors or possibly the lower parts of the warps. There were only minor differences when grouping the tracks according to light level, fish size, and fish density. },

These models have been applied to many different problems, including speech recognition, precipitation modeling, and gene finding and profiling. Typically, HMMs are applied to individual stochastic processes; HMMs for simultaneously modeling multiple processes—as in the longitudinal data setting—have not been widely studied. In this article I present a new class of models, mixed HMMs (MHMMs), where I use both covariates and random effects to capture differences among processes. I define the models using the framework of generalized linear mixed models and discuss their interpretation. I then provide algorithms for parameter estimation and illustrate the properties of the estimators via a simulation study. Finally, to demonstrate the practical uses of MHMMs, I provide an application to data on lesion counts in multiple sclerosis patients. I show that my model, while parsimonious, can describe the...},

abstract = {A study of the lesions of beaked whales (BWs) in a recent mass stranding in the Canary Islands following naval exercises provides a possible explanation of the relationship between anthropogenic, acoustic (sonar) activities and the stranding and death of marine mammals. Fourteen BWs were stranded in the Canary Islands close to the site of an international naval exercise (Neo-Tapon 2002) held on 24 September 2002. Strandings began about 4 hours after the onset of midfrequency sonar activity. Eight Cuvier's BWs (Ziphius cavirostris), one Blainville's BW (Mesoplodon densirostris), and one Gervais' BW (Mesoplodon europaeus) were examined postmortem and studied histopathologically. No inflammatory or neoplastic processes were noted, and no pathogens were identified. Macroscopically, whales had severe, diffuse congestion and hemorrhage, especially around the acoustic jaw fat, ears, brain, and kidneys. Gas bubble-associated lesions and fat embolism were observed in the vessels and parenchyma of vital organs. In vivo bubble formation associated with sonar exposure that may have been exacerbated by modified diving behavior caused nitrogen supersaturation above a threshold value normally tolerated by the tissues (as occurs in decompression sickness). Alternatively, the effect that sonar has on tissues that have been supersaturated with nitrogen gas could be such that it lowers the threshold for the expansion of in vivo bubble precursors (gas nuclei). Exclusively or in combination, these mechanisms may enhance and maintain bubble growth or initiate embolism. Severely injured whales died or became stranded and died due to cardiovascular collapse during beaching. The present study demonstrates a new pathologic entity in cetaceans. The syndrome is apparently induced by exposure to mid-frequency sonar signals and particularly affects deep, long-duration, repetitive-diving species like BWs.},

While efforts have been made to document the effects of such anthropogenic (human-generated) sounds on marine mammals, the effects of excess noise on fishes are poorly understood. We examined the short- and long-term effects of increased ambient sound on the stress and hearing of goldfish (Carassius auratus; a hearing specialist). We reared fish under either quiet (110-125 dB re 1 {\{}micro{\}}Pa) or noisy (white noise, 160-170 dB re 1 {\{}micro{\}}Pa) conditions and examined animals after specific durations of noise exposure. We assessed noise-induced alterations in physiological stress by measuring plasma cortisol and glucose levels and in hearing capabilities by using auditory brainstem responses. Noise exposure did not produce long-term physiological stress responses in goldfish, but a transient spike in plasma cortisol did occur within 10 min of the noise onset. Goldfish had significant threshold shifts in hearing after only 10 min of noise exposure, and these shifts increased linearly up to approximately 28 dB after 24 h of noise exposure. Further noise exposure did not increase threshold shifts, suggesting an asymptote of maximal hearing loss within 24 h. After 21 days of noise exposure, it took goldfish 14 days to fully recover to control hearing levels. This study shows that hearing-specialist fishes may be susceptible to noise-induced stress and hearing loss.},

However, it has yet to be empirically demonstrated how sonar could induce these strandings or cause physiological effects. In controlled experimental studies, we show that mid-frequency sonar can induce temporary hearing loss in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Mild-behavioural alterations were also associated with the exposures. The auditory effects were induced only by repeated exposures to intense sonar pings with total sound exposure levels of 214 dB re: 1 microPa(2) s. Data support an increasing energy model to predict temporary noise-induced hearing loss and indicate that odontocete noise exposure effects bear trends similar to terrestrial mammals. Thus, sonar can induce physiological and behavioural effects in at least one species of odontocete; however, exposures must be of prolonged, high sound exposures levels to generate these effects.},

Here, we demonstrate that anatomical limitations force a necessary trade-off between responsiveness and resolution with increases in animal size. To determine whether responsiveness is prioritized over resolution, or resolution over responsiveness, we studied how size influences the physiological mechanisms underlying sensorimotor control. Using both new electrophysiological experiments and existing data, we determined the maximum axonal conduction velocity (CV) in animals ranging in size from shrews to elephants. Over the 100-fold increase in leg length, CV was nearly constant, increasing proportionally with mass to the 0.04 power. As a consequence, larger animals are burdened with relatively long physiological delays, which may have broad implications for their behaviour, ecology and evolution, including constraining agility and requiring prediction to help control movements.},

Here we examine whistle production by free-ranging adult bottlenose dolphins. Whistles were recorded from each of 13 dolphins while they were restrained and free-swimming. Eleven of the 13 animals produced whistles while free-swimming that matched whistles produced while restrained. On average, 51{\%} of the whistles an animal produced while free-swimming matched whistles recorded while that animal was gently restrained. Of those free-swimming whistles that matched restrained whistles, 76{\%} matched signature whistles. A further analysis was conducted to determine the social contexts in which free-swimming dolphins produced signature whistles. An adult, allied male was most likely to produce signature whistles when voluntarily separated from his partner, and least likely to when together with his partner. These results suggest that wild bottlenose dolphins use signature whistles as contact calls, similar to captive dolphins. The majority of whistles produced by a pair of allied males in a consortship with a female were variant whistles. A final analysis showed that signature whistles appear individually distinctive, consistent with their use as contact calls, while variant whistles do not.},

abstract = {Eusocial societies present a Darwinian paradox, yet they have evolved independently in insects, mole-rats and symbiotic shrimp. Historically, eusociality has been thought to arise as a response to ecological challenges, mediated by kin selection, but the role of kin selection has recently been questioned. Here we use phylogenetically independent contrasts to test the association of eusociality with ecological performance and genetic structure (via life history) among 20 species of sponge-dwelling shrimp () in Belize. Consistent with hypotheses that cooperative groups enjoy an advantage in challenging habitats, we show that eusocial species are more abundant, occupy more sponges and have broader host ranges than non-social sister species, and that these patterns are robust to correction for the generally smaller body sizes of eusocial species. In contrast, body size explains less or no variation after accounting for sociality. Despite strong ecological pressures on most sponge-dwellers, however, eusociality arose only in species with non-dispersing larvae, which form family groups subject to kin selection. Thus, superior ability to hold valuable resources may favour eusociality in shrimp but close genetic relatedness is nevertheless key to its origin, as in other eusocial animals.},

abstract = {Small cetaceans are susceptible to incidental mortality in the various forms of gillnet fisheries throughout their range. Research conducted since 1994 has shown that acoustic alarms (pingers) emitting high-frequency pulsed sounds effectively reduce the number of harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena casualties in sink gillnets. However, the mechanisms behind the effects of pingers were still not understood. Until now, advantages and risks associated with their widespread use could not be evaluated. Here we present the results of 2 field experiments: (1) theodolite-tracking of harbor porpoises exposed to a single PICE-pinger in Clayoquot Sound, Vancouver Island, Canada and (2) herring Clupea harengus capture rates in surface gillnets equipped with and without acoustic alarms (Dukane Netmark 1000, Lien, PICE) in the Baltic Sea herring fishery at Rugen Island, Germany. Our results show that harbor porpoises do not seem to react to an experimental net in their foraging area (n = 172 groups, median group size = 2 porpoises). Porpoise distance from the mid-point of the net was distributed around a median of only 150 m (range 4 to 987 m). A net equipped with an acoustic alarm, however, was avoided (n = 44 groups) within audible range (distance distribution median = 530 m, range 130 to 1140 m). The porpoises were thus effectively excluded from the ensonified area. Herring, one of the main prey species of harbor porpoises, were not affected by the acoustic alarms tested (n = 25 407 fish captured). The advantages and risks of using acoustic alarms to mitigate by-catch are discussed.},

abstract = {1. Body condition plays a fundamental role in many ecological and evolutionary processes at a variety of scales and across a broad range of animal taxa. An understanding of how body condition changes at fine spatial and temporal scales as a result of interaction with the environment provides necessary information about how animals acquire resources. 2. However, comparatively little is known about intra- and interindividual variation of condition in marine systems. Where condition has been studied, changes typically are recorded at relatively coarse time-scales. By quantifying how fine-scale interaction with the environment influences condition, we can broaden our understanding of how animals acquire resources and allocate them to body stores. 3. Here we used a hierarchical Bayesian state-space model to estimate the body condition as measured by the size of an animal's lipid store in two closely related species of marine predator that occupy different hemispheres: northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina). The observation model linked drift dives to lipid stores. The process model quantified daily changes in lipid stores as a function of the physiological condition of the seal (lipid:lean tissue ratio, departure lipid and departure mass), its foraging location, two measures of behaviour and environmental covariates. 4. We found that physiological condition significantly impacted lipid gain at two time-scales - daily and at departure from the colony - that foraging location was significantly associated with lipid gain in both species of elephant seals and that long-term behavioural phase was associated with positive lipid gain in northern and southern elephant seals. In northern elephant seals, the occurrence of short-term behavioural states assumed to represent foraging were correlated with lipid gain. Lipid gain was a function of covariates in both species. Southern elephant seals performed fewer drift dives than northern elephant seals and gained lipids at a lower rate. 5. We have demonstrated a new way to obtain time series of body condition estimates for a marine predator at fine spatial and temporal scales. This modelling approach accounts for uncertainty at many levels and has the potential to integrate physiological and movement ecology of top predators. The observation model we used was specific to elephant seals, but the process model can readily be applied to other species, providing an opportunity to understand how animals respond to their environment at a fine spatial scale.},

This uncertainty, combined with a lengthy and complex Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) phase prior to consent, has slowed the growth of the marine renewables sector. Information on completed and ongoing EIAs at MREI sites across Europe was summarised and compared amongst sites and with completed, comprehensive EIAs for Horns Rev offshore wind farm and the SeaGen tidal turbine site at Strangford Lough. This allowed for the identification of commonalities and differences in monitoring activities, and of data gaps in the wave energy EIA process. Studies on the socio-economic impacts of MREIs were lacking, as were monitoring of fish, fish habitats, electromagnetic fields and their impacts on marine wildlife. Even amongst sites monitoring similar topics, methodologies varied greatly. Science cannot inform the management of marine renewables whilst there are inconsistencies in baseline and impact monitoring, as this study has documented. A streamlined EIA process and collaborations between researchers and developers are required to move the industry forward.},

abstract = {Underwater sound was recorded in one of the major coastal foraging areas for juvenile sea turtles in the Peconic Bay Estuary system in Long Island, New York. The recording season of the underwater environment coincided with the sea turtle activity season in an inshore area where there is considerable boating and recreational activity, especially during the summer between Independence Day and Labor Day. Within the range of sea turtle hearing, average noise pressure reached 110 dB during periods of high human activity and diminished proportionally, down to 80 dB, with decreasing human presence. Therefore, during much of the season when sea turtles are actively foraging in New York waters, their coastal habitats are flooded with underwater noise. During the period of highest human activity, average noise pressures within the range of frequencies heard by sea turtles were greater by over two orders of magnitude (26 dB) than during the lowest period of human activity. Sea turtles undoubtedly are exposed to high levels of noise, most of which is anthropogenic. Results suggest that continued exposure to existing high levels of pervasive anthropogenic  noise in vital sea turtle habitats and any increase in noise could affect sea turtle behavior and ecology.},

abstract = {To assess population genetic structure and evolutionary relationships among nesting populations of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), we analyzed mitochondrial (mt) DNA variation in 113 samples from four nesting beaches in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean and from one nesting beach in the Mediterranean Sea. Significant differences in haplotype frequency between nesting populations in Florida and in Georgia/South Carolina, and between both of these assemblages and the Mediterranean nesting colony, indicate substantial restrictions on contemporary gene flow between regional populations, and therefore a strong tendency for natal homing by females. Nonetheless, this regional genetic structure appears shallow, indicating recent evolutionary connections among rookeries. Data from tag returns and mtDNA, as well as geological considerations, suggest that over short evolutionary time scales (perhaps a few thousand years), dispersal by female loggerheads is sufficient to allow colonization of appropriate habitat in proximity to established rookeries but is too low to significantly affect the population dynamics of rookeries on a contemporary time scale. These data indicate that nesting populations of the loggerhead turtle must be managed as demographically independent units. The population subdivisions based on mtDNA analyses are concordant with previously reported distinctions between Florida and Georgia/South Carolina nesting populations based on environmental markers, tag recaptures, and morphology. Con el prop{\'{o}}sito de evaluar la estructura gen{\'{e}}tica de las poblaciones y las relaciones evolutivas entre poblaciones anidadoras de la tortuga caguama (Caretta caretta), analizamos la variaci{\'{o}}n en el ADN mitocondrial (ADNmt) de 113 muestras provenientes de cuatro playas de anidaci{\'{o}}n en el Oc{\'{e}}ano Atl{\'{a}}ntico noroccidental y de una en el Mar Mediterr{\'{a}}neo.

abstract = {Humpback whale diving behavior changes subtly when exposed to signals transmitted from the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) sound projector located 14 km offshore the island of Kauai. This study considered whether such responses would lead to changes in distribution and abundance. A land-based shore station measured humpback whale locations (scan samples) for both nearshore ({\textless}5 km) and offshore (5-10 km) areas. Control observations were made in 1994 and 1998. In 1998 multiple-day blocks with ATOC transmissions were interspersed with multiple-day control blocks without transmissions. Sighting rates were higher in 1998 (ATOC) than in 1994 (control year), probably due to better sighting conditions, but may reflect increased Population size. Sighting rates did not differ between control and ATOC conditions in 1998. A seasonal sighting peak was observed in both years. No vessel effect on sighting rate was detected in 1998. There was no effect of ATOC on the distance from the shore station to whales, or the depth of water where pods were located. However, the distribution of whales shifted slightly eastward during the ATOC blocks and the mean distance between the ATOC source and pods was greater during transmissions. Nonetheless, more whales were found close to the source when it was on, suggesting a more variable response rather than simple avoidance, with whales found both closer to, and farther away from, the source during transmissions.},

abstract = {Parental attention of Alaska fur seals is minimal. The bulls ignore the pups. The cows rebuff all pups but their own. Birth is rapid and delivery usually takes less than 10 minutes. The f{\ae}tal membranes are not eaten, nor is the umbilical cord bitten. The females smell but do not groom or lick their freshly delivered pups. In the first hours after giving birth, the female will retrieve her pup if it is displaced and also will carry it in her mouth away from danger or disturbance. She threatens and bites other females that disturb either her or her pup. This attentive and protective behaviour is confined exclusively to the few days between parturition and {\ae}strus and is conspicuous only for a period of a few hours to a day post partum. Pups can locomote and vocalise within a minute of birth. Nursing may begin within a few minutes of birth. Even before the umbilical cord is broken, they scratch, shake off water, threaten, and vocalise in the manner characteristic of their species. A hungry pup will attempt to suck any female but a female will suckle no pup but her own. Since post {\ae}strus females spend not more than one day per week ashore, the pups are unattended most of the time. When a female returns from the sea, local geography supplies the primary cue for finding her young. She comes ashore in the general area where she bore her pup (the pup remains in the same general vicinity) and gives a characteristic vocalisation. She is at once approached by the numerous hungry pups in the vicinity. She sniffs at each as it approaches and threatens all except her own, which she allows to suck. If her pup is not one of those that approaches her, she wanders through the rookery calling and sniffing pups until she finds it. Pups aggregate in structureless social groups which form on the rookery in areas of minimal disturbance. By the age of three or four weeks, they wander extensively in the rookery. Most of their time is spent sleeping, grooming, or playfighting. Copulatory play may occur in pups less than one month old. The pups can swim at birth but avoid the water for the first three or four weeks of life. They receive no parental instruction in swimming or in anything else. Fur seal pups are as advanced at birth as dog puppies at three weeks of age. Socialisation begins immediately after birth and after the age of one week is almost exclusively dependent on other pups. After the age of one week except for being suckled on about one day per week, the pups receive nothing but rebuffs and injury from the adults. They find their social ties almost exclusively with members of their own age class. This age class dependence in social contacts persists for several years, particularly in the males.},

Enhanced primary production results in an accumulation of particulate organic matter, which encourages microbial activity and the consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters.

abstract = {Female midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) use the auditory sense to detect and locate vocalizing males during the breeding season. Detection of conspecific vocal signals is essential to their reproductive success and can evoke strong phonotactic responses in gravid females but not in spent females that have released all of their eggs. Here, we test the hypothesis that seasonal variation in reproductive state affects the neurophysiological response properties of the peripheral auditory system in female midshipman fish. Iso-intensity responses of eighth nerve afferents from the sacculus, the main auditory end organ of the inner ear, to individual tones were measured for spike rate and vector strength (VS) of synchronization. Most auditory saccular units in reproductive, summer females showed robust temporal encoding up to 340 Hz, whereas nonreproductive winter females showed comparable encoding only up to 100 Hz. The dramatic upward shift in temporal encoding among summer fish was paralleled by increases in best frequency (BF), maximum evoked spike rate at BF, VS values at BF, and the percentage of units that showed significant VS to iso-intensity tones {\textgreater}140 Hz. Reproductive summer females were best suited to encode the higher harmonic components of male advertisement calls. This first demonstration of a natural cyclicity in peripheral auditory frequency sensitivity among vertebrates may represent, in this case, an adaptive plasticity of the female midshipman's auditory system to enhance the acquisition of auditory information needed for mate identification and localization during the breeding season.},

abstract = {Beaked whales, specifically Blainville's (Mesoplodon densirostris) and Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris), are known to feed in the Tongue of the Ocean, Bahamas. These whales can be reliably detected and often localized within the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) acoustic sensor system. The AUTEC range is a regularly spaced bottom mounted hydrophone array covering {\textgreater}350 nm2 providing a valuable network to record anthropogenic noise and marine mammal vocalizations. Assessments of the potential risks of noise exposure to beaked whales have historically occurred in the absence of information about the physical and biological environments in which these animals are distributed. In the fall of 2008, we used a downward looking 38 kHz SIMRAD EK60 echosounder to measure prey scattering layers concurrent with fine scale turbulence measurements from an autonomous turbulence profiler. Using an 8 km, 4-leaf clover sampling pattern, we completed a total of 7.5 repeat surveys with concurrently measured physical and biological oceanographic parameters, so as to examine the spatiotemporal scales and relationships among turbulence levels, biological scattering layers, and beaked whale foraging activity. We found a strong correlation among increased prey density and ocean vertical structure relative to increased click densities. Understanding the habitats of these whales and their utilization patterns will improve future models of beaked whale habitat as well as allowing more comprehensive assessments of exposure risk to anthropogenic sound.},

abstract = {We perform Bayesian phylogenetic analyses on cytochrome b sequences from 264 of the 290 extant cetartiodactyl mammals (whales plus even-toed ungulates) and two recently extinct species, the 'Mouse Goat' and the 'Irish Elk'. Previous primary analyses have included only a small portion of the species diversity within Cetartiodactyla, while a complete supertree analysis lacks resolution and branch lengths limiting its utility for comparative studies. The benefits of using a single-gene approach include rapid phylogenetic estimates for a large number of species. However, single-gene phylogenies often differ dramatically from studies involving multiple datasets suggesting that they often are unreliable. However, based on recovery of benchmark clades-clades supported in prior studies based on multiple independent datasets-and recovery of undisputed traditional taxonomic groups, Cytb performs extraordinarily well in resolving cetartiodactyl phylogeny when taxon sampling is dense. Missing data, however, (taxa with partial sequences) can compromise phylogenetic accuracy, suggesting a tradeoff between the benefits of adding taxa and introducing question marks. In the full data, a few species with a short sequences appear misplaced, however, sequence length alone seems a poor predictor of this phenomenon as other taxa with equally short sequences were not conspicuously misplaced. Although we recommend awaiting a better supported phylogeny based on more character data to reconsider classification and taxonomy within Cetartiodactyla, the new phylogenetic hypotheses provided here represent the currently best available tool for comparative species-level studies within this group. Cytb has been sequenced for a large percentage of mammals and appears to be a reliable phylogenetic marker as long as taxon sampling is dense. Therefore, an opportunity exists now to reconstruct detailed phylogenies of most of the major mammalian clades to rapidly provide much needed tools for species-level comparative studies.},

abstract = {A mathematical model, based on current knowledge of gas exchange and physiology of marine mammals, was used to predict blood and tissue tension N2 (PN2) using field data from three beaked whale species: northern bottlenose whales, Cuvier's beaked whales, and Blainville's beaked whales. The objective was to determine if physiology (body mass, diving lung volume, dive response) or dive behaviour (dive depth and duration, changes in ascent rate, diel behaviour) would lead to differences in PN2 levels and thereby decompression sickness (DCS) risk between species. Diving lung volume and extent of the dive response had a large effect on end-dive PN2. The dive profile had a larger influence on end-dive PN2 than body mass differences between species. Despite diel changes in dive behaviour, PN2 levels showed no consistent trend. Model output suggested that all three species live with tissue PN2 levels that would cause a significant proportion of DCS cases in terrestrial mammals. Cuvier's beaked whale diving behaviour appears to put them at higher risk than the other species, which may explain their prevalence in strandings after the use of mid-frequency sonar.},

abstract = {Toothed whales emit high-powered ultrasonic clicks to echolocate a wide range of prey. It may be hypothesized that some of their prey species have evolved capabilities to detect and respond to such ultrasonic pulses in a way that reduces predation, akin to the situation for many nocturnal insects and echolocating bats. Using high-speed film recordings and controlled exposures, we obtained behavioural evidence that simulated toothed whale biosonar clicks elicit highly directional anti-predator responses in an ultrasound-sensitive allis shad (Alosa alosa). Ten shad were exposed to 192 dB re. 1 $\mu$Pa (pp) clicks centred at 40 kHz at repetition rates of 1, 20, 50 and 250 clicks s(-1) with summed energy flux density levels of 148, 161, 165 and 172 dB re. 1 $\mu$Pa(2) s. The exposures mimicked the acoustic exposure from a delphinid toothed whale in different phases of prey search and capture. The response times of allis shad were faster for higher repetition rates of clicks with the same sound pressure level. None of the fish responded to a single click, but had median response times of 182, 93 and 57 ms when exposed to click rates of 20, 50 and 250 clicks s(-1), respectively. This suggests that the ultrasound detector of allis shad is an energy detector and that shad respond faster when exposed to a nearby fast-clicking toothed whale than to a slow-clicking toothed whale far away. The findings are thus consistent with the hypothesis that shad ultrasound detection is used for reducing predation from echolocating toothed whales.},

abstract = {Abstract  Empirical research on human and non-human primates suggests that communication sounds express the intensity of an emotional state of a signaller. In the present study, we have examined communication sounds during induced social interactions of a monogamous mammal, the tree shrew. To signal their unwillingness to mate, female tree shrews show defensive threat displays towards unfamiliar males paralleled by acoustically variable squeaks. We assumed that the distance between interacting partners as well as the behavior of the male towards the female indicates the intensity of perceived social threat and thereby the arousal state of a female. To explore this hypothesis we analyzed dynamic changes in communication sounds uttered during induced social interactions between a female and an unfamiliar male. Detailed videographic and sound analyzes revealed that the arousal state predicted variations in communication sound structure reliably. Both, a decrease of distance and a male approaching the female led to an increase in fundamental frequency and repetition rate of syllables. These findings support comparable results in human and non-human primates and suggest that common coding rules in communication sounds govern acoustic conflict regulation in mammals.},

Nonhomogeneous Markov models occur most commonly when baseline transition intensities depend on calendar time, but may also occur with deterministic time-dependent covariates such as age. We propose transition intensities based on B-splines as a smooth alternative to piecewise constant intensities and also as a generalization of time transformation models. An expansion of the system of differential equations allows first derivatives of the likelihood to be obtained, which can be used in a Fisher scoring algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation. The method is evaluated through a small simulation study and demonstrated on data relating to the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy in posttransplantation patients.},

The ecology of these toothed cetaceans is poorly documented worldwide. The present study described their prey preferences from stomach content analysis and showed resource partitioning within the assemblage. The majority of the species appeared to be mostly teutophageous. Fish was an important food source only for the Sowerby's beaked whale and, to a lesser extent, for the long-finned pilot whale. In terms of foraging habitats inferred from prey composition, either pelagic oceanic or demersal neritic habitats were exploited by toothed whales in the Bay of Biscay, with only the long-finned pilot whale foraging in the two habitats. Finally, with more than 14,000 identified cephalopods from 39 species, the present study highlighted also the poorly known deep-sea cephalopod community off the Bay of Biscay using top predators as biological samplers.},

abstract = {The target strengths and swimbladder morphology of six snapper species were investigated using broadband sonar, x rays, and swimbladder casts. Backscatter data were obtained using a frequency-modulated sweep (60-200 kHz) and a broadband, dolphinlike click (peak frequency 120 kHz) from live fish, mounted and rotated around each of their three axes. X rays revealed species-specific differences in the shape, size, and orientation of the swimbladders. The angle between the fish's dorsal aspect and the major axis of its swimbladder ranged from 3degrees to 12degrees and was consistent between individuals within a species. This angle had a one-to-one relationship with the angle at which the maximum dorsal aspect target strength was measured (r(2)=0.93), regardless of species. Maximum dorsal aspect target strength was correlated with length within species. However, the swimbladder modeled as an air-filled prolate spheroid with axes measured from the x rays of the swimbladder predicted maximum target strength significantly better than models based on fish length or swimbladder volume. For both the dorsal and lateral aspects, the prolate spheroid model's predictions were not significantly different from the measured target strengths (observed power {\textgreater}0.75) and were within 3 dB of the measured values. This model predicts the target strengths of all species equally well, unlike those based on length. (C) 2003 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {A population of Edith's checkerspot butterfly, Euphydryas editha, laid eggs on two morphologically distinct host-plant species, one of which it had recently colonized. Search behaviour of two groups of females was compared in the held. 'Naive' females were experimentally deprived of both flight experience and host encounter, while 'experienced' females were observed without intervention. Three analyses failed to show evidence for adaptive learning that might have allowed the butterflies to increase their efficiency of host finding with experience: (1) proportions of alights on hosts were not different between the naive and experienced groups, (2) rates of alighting on hosts did not differ between the naive and experienced groups, and (3) probabilities of alighting on hosts did not increase during searching bouts. Both groups searched efficiently for their traditional host species, Pedicularis semibarbata (dwarf lousewort), and inefficiently for the novel host, Collinsia torreyi (blue-eyed Mary). There was also no evidence for behavioural differences among individuals of either group. The distribution among individuals of alight frequencies on C. torreyi appeared Poisson, with a single mode near the frequency expected from random alighting. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that no females recognized C. torreyi as a host in flight, and that differences between butterflies in observed alight frequencies stemmed simply from random variation in the composition of the vegetation over which they flew. Thus, the absence of adaptive learning impeded the evolutionary incorporation of the novel host into the diet. These results complement previous findings that E. editha from the same population failed to learn to accept particular hosts after alighting and are in contrast to other studies of insect foraging, all of which have shown that learning is an important component of foraging behaviour, causing search efficiency to improve with experience. It is suggested that E. editha could be a model 'non-learning' insect in comparative studies that empirically test the role of learning in resource choice.

abstract = {Global increases in environmental noise levels - arising from expansion of human populations, transportation networks, and resource extraction - have catalysed a recent surge of research into the effects of noise on wildlife. Synthesising a coherent understanding of the biological consequences of noise from this literature is challenging. Taxonomic groups vary in auditory capabilities. A wide range of noise sources and exposure levels occur, and many kinds of biological responses have been observed, ranging from individual behaviours to changes in ecological communities. Also, noise is one of several environmental effects generated by human activities, so researchers must contend with potentially confounding explanations for biological responses. Nonetheless, it is clear that noise presents diverse threats to species and ecosystems and salient patterns are emerging to help inform future natural resource-management decisions. We conducted a systematic and standardised review of the scientific literature published from 1990 to 2013 on the effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife, including both terrestrial and aquatic studies. Research to date has concentrated predominantly on European and North American species that rely on vocal communication, with approximately two-thirds of the data set focussing on songbirds and marine mammals. The majority of studies documented effects from noise, including altered vocal behaviour to mitigate masking, reduced abundance in noisy habitats, changes in vigilance and foraging behaviour, and impacts on individual fitness and the structure of ecological communities. This literature survey shows that terrestrial wildlife responses begin at noise levels of approximately 40 dBA, and 20{\%} of papers documented impacts below 50 dBA. Our analysis highlights the utility of existing scientific information concerning the effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife for predicting potential outcomes of noise exposure and implementing meaningful mitigation measures. Future research directions that would support more comprehensive predictions regarding the magnitude and severity of noise impacts include: broadening taxonomic and geographical scope, exploring interacting stressors, conducting larger-scale studies, testing mitigation approaches, standardising reporting of acoustic metrics, and assessing the biological response to noise-source removal or mitigation. The broad volume of existing information concerning the effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife offers a valuable resource to assist scientists, industry, and natural-resource managers in predicting potential outcomes of noise exposure.},

abstract = {The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) provides a globally significant demonstration of the effectiveness of large-scale networks of marine reserves in contributing to integrated, adaptive management. Comprehensive review of available evidence shows major, rapid benefits of no-take areas for targeted fish and sharks, in both reef and nonreef habitats, with potential benefits for fisheries as well as biodiversity conservation. Large, mobile species like sharks benefit less than smaller, site-attached fish. Critically, reserves also appear to benefit overall ecosystem health and resilience: outbreaks of coral-eating, crown-of-thorns starfish appear less frequent on no-take reefs, which consequently have higher abundance of coral, the very foundation of reef ecosystems. Effective marine reserves require regular review of compliance: fish abundances in no-entry zones suggest that even no-take zones may be significantly depleted due to poaching. Spatial analyses comparing zoning with seabed biodiversity or dugong distributions illustrate significant benefits from application of best-practice conservation principles in data-poor situations. Increases in the marine reserve network in 2004 affected fishers, but preliminary economic analysis suggests considerable net benefits, in terms of protecting environmental and tourism values. Relative to the revenue generated by reef tourism, current expenditure on protection is minor. Recent implementation of an Outlook Report provides regular, formal review of environmental condition and management and links to policy responses, key aspects of adaptive management. Given the major threat posed by climate change, the expanded network of marine reserves provides a critical and cost-effective contribution to enhancing the resilience of the Great Barrier Reef.},

abstract = {Vocalizations are an important component of male elephant seat agonistic behaviour. Acoustic and behavioural components of vocalizations emitted during agonistic contests show gross differences between young and old males, but the variation with age depends on the specific feature. Vocalizations become more frequent and effective at later ages. Acoustic features that are constrained by structural phenotype, which changes with age, also should change with age, while acoustic features that are independent from structural phenotype should show no relationship with age. We demonstrate that, in southern elephant seals, formant frequencies, which are constrained by the vocal tract length and, therefore, by body size, show a clear decrease with age, whereas temporal and structural features of sounds, which potentially are unconstrained, show no correlation with age. Formants ontogeny seems, therefore, to be mostly the result of body maturation, and hence formants may be reliable signals of age. In contrast, acoustic features such as temporal features and syllable structure, are free to change, and hence may serve as the raw material for vocal learning and individual recognition.},

Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) was the most important prey, occurring in 78{\%} of noncalf porpoise stomachs and contributing 44{\%} of ingested mass. Pearlsides (Maurolicus weitzmani), silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis), and red and white hake (Urophycis spp.) were common prey items. There were no significant differences among diets of sex and maturity groups, but the calf diet differed significantly from adults in number of Atlantic herring eaten and the total mass of food consumed. At four to seven months of age, calves were eating pearlsides, small silver hake, and euphausiids (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) while still nursing.},

abstract = {In June 2008, two pygmy killer whales (Feresa attenuata) were stranded alive near Boca Grande, FL, USA, and were taken into rehabilitation. We used this opportunity to learn about the peripheral anatomy of the auditory system and hearing sensitivity of these rare toothed whales. Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of head structures from X-ray computed tomography (CT) images revealed mandibles that were hollow, lacked a bony lamina medial to the pan bone and contained mandibular fat bodies that extended caudally and abutted the tympanoperiotic complex. Using auditory evoked potential (AEP) procedures, the modulation rate transfer function was determined. Maximum evoked potential responses occurred at modulation frequencies of 500 and 1000 Hz. The AEP-derived audiograms were U-shaped. The lowest hearing thresholds occurred between 20 and 60 kHz, with the best hearing sensitivity at 40 kHz. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) was composed of seven waves and resembled the ABR of the bottlenose and common dolphins. By changing electrode locations, creating 3-D reconstructions of the brain from CT images and measuring the amplitude of the ABR waves, we provided evidence that the neuroanatomical sources of ABR waves I, IV and VI were the auditory nerve, inferior colliculus and the medial geniculate body, respectively. The combination of AEP testing and CT imaging provided a new synthesis of methods for studying the auditory system of cetaceans.},

Localization by using passive acoustic data (time of arrival of source signals at receptors) is assisted by using visual data (coordinates of the whale when diving and resurfacing) and tag information (movement statistics). The efficiency of the Bayesian method is compared to the standard minimum mean squared error statistical approach by comparing the reconstruction results of 48 simulated sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) trajectories. The use of the advanced Bayesian method reduces bias (standard deviation) with respect to the standard method up to a factor of 8.9 (13.6). The author provides open-source software which is functional with acoustic data which would be collected in the field from any three-dimensional receptor array design. This approach renews passive acoustics as a valuable tool to study the underwater behavior of toothed whales.},

We used a linear, vertical array of three hydrophones (depth 10 m, 30 m, 100 m) with a fourth hydrophone (depth 30 m) about 20 m from the vertical array. A smaller fifth hydrophone (depth 2 m) allowed for registering frequencies up to 125 kHz (+/- 2 dB) when signals were recorded at 762 mm/sec on an instrumentation tape recorder. Clicks were the prevalent signals, but we heard whistles occasionally. We separated the clicks into two classes: click trains that had rates of 3-10 clicks/sec and click bursts having rates of 110-150 dicks/sec. The spectra of train;licks had maximum amplitudes at 48 +/- 10 kHz and a duration of 29 +/- 6 mu sec. The spectra of burst clicks had maximum amplitudes at 19 +/- 1 kHz and a duration of 40 +/- 3 mu sec. By analogy with other dolphin species, narwhals presumably use the clicks for echolocation during orientation and for locating prey. The narwhal click patterns resemble those of insectivorous bats. Click trains might correspond to bat searching signals and click bursts to the bat's terminal ''buzz'', emitted just before prey capture.},

abstract = {Sperm whales produce different click types for echolocation and communication. Usual clicks and buzzes appear to be used primarily in foraging while codas are thought to function in social communication. The function of slow clicks is less clear, but they appear to be produced by males at higher latitudes, where they primarily forage solitarily, and on the breeding grounds, where they roam between groups of females. Here the behavioral context in which these vocalizations are produced and the function they may serve was investigated. Ninety-nine hours of acoustic and diving data were analyzed from sound recording tags on six male sperm whales in Northern Norway. The 755 slow clicks detected were produced by tagged animals at the surface (52{\%}), ascending from a dive (37{\%}), and during the bottom phase (11{\%}), but never during the descent. Slow clicks were not associated with the production of buzzes, other echolocation clicks, or fast maneuvering that would indicate foraging. Some slow clicks were emitted in seemingly repetitive temporal patterns supporting the hypothesis that the function for slow clicks on the feeding grounds is long range communication between males, possibly relaying information about individual identity or behavioral states.},

abstract = {Abstract: In crowded aggregations that occur in breeding colonies, female pinnipeds commonly become separated from their pups and may use spatial, olfactory, or auditory cues to locate them. A system of mutual recognition based on vocalizations is known for otariids. Female phocids are known to use location and olfaction to help identify pups, but evidence for vocal recognition is weak. During the 1997 breeding season on the Isle of May, Scotland, vocalizations were recorded from grey seal, Halichoerus grypus, pups; playback experiments were carried out; and nursing of nonfilial pups was observed. Pup vocalizations were found to be both stereotyped and individually distinctive, features normally associated with a system of individual recognition. However, playback experiments revealed that mothers did not respond more to vocalizations of their own pups than to those of nonfilial pups. Furthermore, seventeen cases of allo-suckling were observed during 68 h of observation on the colony. High densities of animals and frequent separations present challenges to identification of pups by their mothers.},

The maximum source level was more than 30 dB above what has been measured from captive animals, while the spectral and temporal properties were comparable. Calculations based on the sonar equation indicate that harbour porpoises, using these high click intensities, should be capable of detecting fish and nets and should be detectable by porpoise detectors over significantly larger distances than had previously been assumed. Harbour porpoises in this study preferred a relatively constant inter-click interval of about 60 ms, but intervals up to 200 ms and down to 30 ms were also recorded.},

Following the fourth International Statistical Ecology Conference (1-4 July 2014) in Montpellier, France, we analyse current trends in statistical ecology. Important advances in the analysis of individual movement, and in the modelling of population dynamics and species distributions, are made possible by the increasing use of hierarchical and hidden process models. Exciting research perspectives include the development of methods to interpret citizen science data and of efficient, flexible computational algorithms for model fitting.

abstract = {It has recently been shown that a few fish species, including American shad (Alosa sapidissima; Clupeiformes), are able to detect sound up to 180 kHz, an ability not found in most other fishes. Initially, it was proposed that ultrasound detection in shad involves the auditory bullae, swim bladder extensions found in all members of the Clupeiformes. However, while all clupeiformes have bullae, not all can detect ultrasound. Thus, the bullae alone are not sufficient to explain ultrasound detection. In this study, we used a developmental approach to determine when ultrasound detection begins and how the ability to detect ultrasound changes with ontogeny in American shad. We then compared changes in auditory function with morphological development to identify structures that are potentially responsible for ultrasound detection. We found that the auditory bullae and all three auditory end organs are present well before fish show ultrasound detection behaviourally and we suggest that an additional specialization in the utricle (one of the auditory end organs) forms coincident with the onset of ultrasound detection. We further show that this utricular specialization is found in two clupeiform species that can detect ultrasound but not in two clupeiform species not capable of ultrasound detection. Thus, it appears that ultrasound-detecting clupeiformes have undergone structural modification of the utricle that allows detection of ultrasonic stimulation.},

abstract = {Killer whales () are large predators that occupy the top trophic position in the world's oceans and as such may have important roles in marine ecosystem dynamics. Although the possible top-down effects of killer whale predation on populations of their prey have received much recent attention, little is known of how the abundance of these predators may be limited by bottom-up processes. Here we show, using 25 years of demographic data from two populations of fish-eating killer whales in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, that population trends are driven largely by changes in survival, and that survival rates are strongly correlated with the availability of their principal prey species, Chinook salmon (). Our results suggest that, although these killer whales may consume a variety of fish species, they are highly specialized and dependent on this single salmonid species to an extent that it is a limiting factor in their population dynamics. Other ecologically specialized killer whale populations may be similarly constrained to a narrow range of prey species by culturally inherited foraging strategies, and thus are limited in their ability to adapt rapidly to changing prey availability.},

abstract = {Air guns and air-gun arrays of different volumes are used for scientific seismic surveys with R/V Polarstern in polar regions. To assess the potential risk of these research activities on marine mammal populations, knowledge of the sound pressure field of the seismic sources is essential. Therefore, a broad-band (0201380 kHz) calibration study was conducted at the Heggernes Acoustic Range, Norway. A GI (2.4 l), a G (8.5 l) and a Bolt gun (32.8 l) were deployed as single sources, 3 GI (7.4 l), 3 G (25.6 l) and 8 VLF2122Prakla-Seismos air guns (24.0 l) as arrays. Each configuration was fired along a line of 320134 km length running between two hydrophone chains with receivers in 35, 100, 198 and 263 m depth. Peak-to-peak, zero-to-peak, rms and sound exposure levels (SEL) were analysed as functions of range. They show the typical dipole-like directivity of marine seismic sources with amplitude cancellation close to the sea surface, higher amplitudes in greater depths, and sound pressure levels which continuously decrease with range. Levels recorded during the approach are lower than during the departure indicating a shadowing effect of Polarsterns's hull. Backcalculated zero-to-peak source levels range from 2242013240 dB re 1 03BCPa @ 1 m. Spectral source levels are highest below 100 Hz and amount to 1822013194 dB re 1 03BCPa Hz20131. They drop off continuously with range and frequency. At 1 kHz they are 223C30 dB, at 80 kHz 223C60 dB lower than the peak level. Above 1 kHz amplitude spectra are dominated by Polarstern's self-noise. From the rms and sound exposure levels of the deepest hydrophone radii for different thresholds are derived. For a 180 dB rms-level threshold radii maximally vary between 200 and 600 m, for a 186 dB SEL threshold between 50 and 300 m.},

abstract = {Divergence in acoustic signals between populations of animals can lead to species recognition failure, reproductive isolation, and speciation. Character displacement may facilitate coexistence of species in natural communities, yet evidence for character displacement in acoustic signals is scant. Here, we find evidence of character displacement in song as well as body size and bill size of 2 related African tinkerbirds. Playback experiments indicate that related species' songs are perceived differently in sympatry than in allopatry. We suggest character displacement occurs in phenotypic traits facilitating species recognition, which has important implications for understanding the processes that lead to speciation and diversification. Because many of the sites where the 2 species coexist are areas where pristine rainforest has been degraded, results also suggest that anthropogenic pressures resulting from deforestation may be a contributing cause of character displacement in these species.},

abstract = {The T-POD (Timing POrpoise Detector) is a self-contained acoustic data logger used for detecting and monitoring the presence of echolocation clicks of small cetaceans. It has become a standard tool in environmental impact assessments and monitoring programmes. Yet, little is known about the variability in sensitivity and detection range of T-PODs. In this study the field performance of ten v(3) T-PODs was compared to detection thresholds measured in a lank. The T-POD thresholds ranged from 123 to 132 dB re 1 mu Pa (pp). The detection thresholds of the ten individual T-PODs were different and the differences increased over time. The more sensitive a T-POD was in the laboratory (i.e. the lower the threshold) the more clicks were recorded by it in the field. Threshold correlated differently to the five analysed T-POD parameters (encounters, encounter duration, waiting time, porpoise positive minutes, clicks per porpoise positive minute). This study demonstrates that individual threshold calibrations of T-PODs are necessary to obtain comparable results when monitoring odontocetes with this tool. Regression equations for relationships between T-POD detection thresholds and study parameters obtained during field trials may allow comparisons of T-PODs with different detection thresholds.},

The tagged whales were found together four and eight days after tagging, and were tracked simultaneously for 13 h, over 31 km. Whale movements on different days at the surface averaged from 0.68 to 0.82 m/set, with dive descent rates from 0.82 to 1.13 m/set, ascent rates from 0.74 to 1.16 m/set, and horizontal movement during dives from 0.76 to 1.29 m/set. Dives lasted from 18 min to 1 h and 13 min, averaging 33 and 41 min on different days. Every track ended when tag signals became obscured at night by dense biological scatterers concentrated in offshore areas where the whales were diving. Both tagged whales appear to have been males of 15 and 11m, each dominant in different groups; but when together the larger whale was dominant, as evidenced by chases and agonistic vocalizations. The whales did not appear to react to the tags or to the sounds associated with tracking (30, 32, and 36 kHz).},

Linking such complex data to dynamical models of movement is a major challenge for animal ecology. Here, we review a statistical approach, state-space modelling, which involves changing how we analyse movement data and draw inferences about the behaviours that shape it. The statistical robustness and predictive ability of state-space models make them the most promising avenue towards a new type of movement ecology that fuses insights from the study of animal behaviour, biogeography and spatial population dynamics.},

Data collected during ferry-based cetacean surveys in the English Channel and Bay of Biscay between 1998 and 2002 were analysed to investigate the distribution, encounter rate, and habitat characteristics of toothed cetaceans there. In all, 17 873 nautical miles were surveyed, and 1008 encounters of 13 identified species, including delphinids, ziphiids, harbour porpoise, and sperm whale, were recorded. The common dolphin was the commonest species, followed in decreasing occurrence by striped and bottlenose dolphins, pilot whale, harbour porpoise, Cuvier's beaked whale, and sperm whales. The distribution of harbour porpoises was restricted to the shallow waters of the western English Channel. Common and bottlenose dolphins were distributed mainly over the continental shelf, although there were some encounters along the shelf edge and in the open ocean. Striped dolphins and pilot whales were sighted in oceanic waters in the central and southern Bay of Biscay. Cuvier's beaked whales and sperm whales were recorded in the deep oceanic waters of the southern Bay of Biscay. Bathymetry clearly plays a significant role in the distribution and habitat partitioning of toothed cetaceans in the region.},

abstract = {Passive acoustic detection is being increasingly used to monitor visually cryptic cetaceans such as Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) that may be especially sensitive to underwater sound. The efficacy of passive acoustic detection is traditionally characterized by the probability of detecting the animal's sound emissions as a function of signal-to-noise ratio. The probability of detection can be predicted using accepted, but not necessarily accurate, models of the underwater acoustic environment. Recent field studies combining far-field hydrophone arrays with on-animal acoustic recording tags have yielded the location and time of each sound emission from tagged animals, enabling in-situ measurements of the probability of detection. However, tagging studies can only take place in calm seas and so do not reflect the full range of ambient noise conditions under which passive acoustic detection may be used. Increased surface-generated noise from wind and wave interaction degrades the signal-to-noise ratio of animal sound receptions at a given distance leading to a reduction in probability of detection. This paper presents a case study simulating the effect of increasing ambient noise on detection of M. densirostris foraging clicks recorded from a tagged whale swimming in the vicinity of a deep-water, bottom-mounted hydrophone array.},

abstract = {Change point analysis has applications in a wide variety of fields. The general problem concerns the inference of a change in distribution for a set of time-ordered observations. Sequential detection is an online version in which new data is continually arriving and is analyzed adaptively. We are concerned with the related, but distinct, offline version, in which retrospective analysis of an entire sequence is performed. For a set of multivariate observations of arbitrary dimension, we consider nonparametric estimation of both the number of change points and the positions at which they occur. We do not make any assumptions regarding the nature of the change in distribution or any distribution assumptions beyond the existence of the $\alpha$th absolute moment, for some $\alpha$ ∈ (0,2). Estimation is based on hierarchical clustering and we propose both divisive and agglomerative algorithms. The divisive method is shown to provide consistent estimates of both the number and location of change points under standard regularity assumptions. We compare the proposed approach with competing methods in a simulation study. Methods from cluster analysis are applied to assess performance and to allow simple comparisons of location estimates, even when the estimated number differs. We conclude with applications in genetics, finance and spatio-temporal analysis.},

abstract = {The ability of goldfish to detect a change in the frequency of 400-Hz pure-tone bursts was studied using classical respiratory conditioning. The frequency discrimination threshold was measured at 15-, 35-, and 55-dB sensation level (SL), under conditions of (1) constant intensity, (2) roving intensity (plus and minus 6-dB burst-to-burst variation in intensity), (3) upward frequency change, and (4) downward frequency change. There was no overall effect of SL on frequency discrimination, but roving the intensity elevated thresholds by about 6 Hz (33{\%}) and increased variability. Upward shifts in frequency elevated thresholds slightly (by 2 Hz or 10{\%}) relative to downward shifts. These relatively small and statistically insignificant effects suggest that earlier measures of frequency discrimination in the goldfish are not due to the detection of simple changes in spike rate within individual peripheral channels.},

abstract = {Whale displacement by acoustic "pollution" has been difficult to document, even in cases where it is strongly suspected, because noise effects can rarely be separated from other stimuli. Two independent studies on the natural history of killer whales (Orcinus orca) monitored frequency of whale occurrence from January 1985 through December 2000 in two adjacent areas: Johnstone Strait and the Broughton Archipelago. Four high-amplitude, acoustic harassment devices (AHDs) were installed throughout 1993 on already existing salmon farms in the Broughton Archipelago, in attempts to deter predation on Fish pens by harbour seals (Phoca vitulina Linnaeus). While whale occurrence was relatively stable in both areas until 1993, it then increased slightly in the Johnstone Strait area and declined significantly in the Broughton Archipelago while AHDs were in use, Both mammal-eating and fish-eating killer whales were similarly impacted. Acoustic harassment ended in the Broughton Archipelago in May 1999 and whale occurrence re-established to baseline levels. This study concludes that whale displacement resulted from the deliberate introduction of noise into their environment. (C) International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

Under conditions expected in the 21st century, global warming and ocean acidification will compromise carbonate accretion, with corals becoming increasingly rare on reef systems. The result will be less diverse reef communities and carbonate reef structures that fail to be maintained. Climate change also exacerbates local stresses from declining water quality and overexploitation of key species, driving reefs increasingly toward the tipping point for functional collapse. This review presents future scenarios for coral reefs that predict increasingly serious consequences for reef-associated fisheries, tourism, coastal protection, and people. As the International Year of the Reef 2008 begins, scaled-up management intervention and decisive action on global emissions are required if the loss of coral-dominated ecosystems is to be avoided.},

Using numerical simulations, I quantified the impact of multicollinearity on ecological multiple regression and found that even low levels of collinearity bias analyses (r ≥ 0.28 or r2 ≥ 0.08), causing (1) inaccurate model parameterization, (2) decreased statistical power, and (3) exclusion of significant predictor variables during model creation.

abstract = {Lunge feeding in rorqual whales is a drag-based feeding mechanism that is thought to entail a high energetic cost and consequently limit the maximum dive time of these extraordinarily large predators. Although the kinematics of lunge feeding in fin whales supports this hypothesis, it is unclear whether respiratory compensation occurs as a consequence of lunge-feeding activity. We used high-resolution digital tags on foraging humpback whales (Megaptera novaengliae) to determine the number of lunges executed per dive as well as respiratory frequency between dives. Data from two whales are reported, which together performed 58 foraging dives and 451 lunges. During one study, we tracked one tagged whale for approximately 2 h and examined the spatial distribution of prey using a digital echosounder. These data were integrated with the dive profile to reveal that lunges are directed toward the upper boundary of dense krill aggregations. Foraging dives were characterized by a gliding descent, up to 15 lunges at depth, and an ascent powered by steady swimming. Longer dives were required to perform more lunges at depth and these extended apneas were followed by an increase in the number of breaths taken after a dive. Maximum dive durations during foraging were approximately half of those previously reported for singing (i.e. non-feeding) humpback whales. At the highest lunge frequencies (10 to 15 lunges per dive), respiratory rate was at least threefold higher than that of singing humpback whales that underwent a similar degree of apnea. These data suggest that the high energetic cost associated with lunge feeding in blue and fin whales also occurs in intermediate sized rorquals.},

abstract = {Numerous fish species produce broad-band pulsed sounds with a distinct temporal patterning which is thought to be important during intraspecific communication. In order to determine whether fishes are able to utilize temporal characteristics of acoustic signals, time resolution was determined in four species of otophysines and anabantoids by analyzing auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to double-click stimuli with varying click periods. At click periods of 3.5 ms, two distinct ABRs were clearly detectable in all species. The minimum pulse period resolvable by the auditory system was below 1.5 ms in each species and slightly intensity-dependent. No differences were found between vocal and non-vocal species within each taxon. Comparisons of the time resolution data to the pulse periods of intraspecific sounds in the vocal species showed that the otophysine Platydoras costatus and the anabantoid Trichopsis vittata are likely to process each pulse within a series of intraspecific sounds. However, as non-vocal and vocal species have a similar minimum resolvable click period, the high temporal resolution capacities of the auditory system of fish might not represent special adaptations for intraspecific acoustic communication. Nonetheless, we suggest that temporal characteristics of naturally occurring conspecific and heterospecific sounds provide reliable information for acoustic communication.},

abstract = {  Identifying how social organization shapes individual behavior, survival, and fecundity of animals that live in groups can inform conservation efforts and improve forecasts of population abundance, even when the mechanism responsible for group-level differences is unknown. We constructed a hierarchical Bayesian model to quantify the relative variability in survival rates among different levels of social organization (matrilines and pods) of an endangered population of killer whales (Orcinus orca). Individual killer whales often participate in group activities such as prey sharing and cooperative hunting. The estimated age-specific survival probabilities and survivorship curves differed considerably among pods and to a lesser extent among matrilines (within pods). Across all pods, males had lower life expectancy than females. Differences in survival between pods may be caused by a combination of factors that vary across the population's range, including reduced prey availability, contaminants in prey, and human activity. Our modeling approach could be applied to demographic rates for other species and for parameters other than survival, including reproduction, prey selection, movement, and detection probabilities.},

abstract = {Blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and fin whales (B. physalus) produce high-intensity, low-frequency calls, which probably function for communication during mating and feeding. The source levels of blue and fin whale calls off the Western Antarctic Peninsula were calculated using recordings made with calibrated, bottom-moored hydrophones. Blue whales were located up to a range of 200 km using hyperbolic localization and time difference of arrival. The distance to fin whales, estimated using multipath arrivals of their calls, was up to 56 km. The error in range measurements was 3.8 km using hyperbolic localization, and 3.4 km using multipath arrivals. Both species produced high-intensity calls; the average blue whale call source level was 189 +/- 3 dB re: 1/mu Pa-1 m over 25-29 Hz, and the average fin whale call source level was 189 +/- 4 dB re: 1/mu Pa-1 m over 15-28 Hz. Blue and fin whale populations in the Southern Ocean have remained at low numbers for decades since they became protected; using source level and detection range from passive acoustic recordings can help in calculating the relative density of calling, whales.

The characteristic spectrogram time-frequency (TF) contours of marine mammal vocalizations play a significant role in whistle classification and individual or group identification. A major hurdle in the robust automated extraction of TF contours from spectrograms is underwater noise. An image-based algorithm has been developed for denoising and extraction of TF contours from noisy underwater recordings. An objective procedure for measuring the accuracy of extracted spectrogram contours is also proposed. This method is shown to perform well when dealing with the challenging problem of denoising broadband transients commonly encountered in warm shallow waters inhabited by snapping shrimp. Furthermore, it would also be useful with other types of broadband transient noise. (C) 2008 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances such as fishing, mining, oil drilling, bioprospecting, warming, and acidification in the deep sea are increasing, yet generalities about deep-sea biogeography remain elusive. Owing to the lack of perceived environmental variability and geographical barriers, ranges of deep-sea species were traditionally assumed to be exceedingly large. In contrast, seamount and chemosynthetic habitats with reported high endemicity challenge the broad applicability of a single biogeographic paradigm for the deep sea. New research benefiting from higher resolution sampling, molecular methods and public databases can now more rigorously examine dispersal distances and species ranges on the vast ocean floor. Here, we explore the major outstanding questions in deep-sea biogeography. Based on current evidence, many taxa appear broadly distributed across the deep sea, a pattern replicated in both the abyssal plains and specialized environments such as hydrothermal vents. Cold waters may slow larval metabolism and development augmenting the great intrinsic ability for dispersal among many deep-sea species. Currents, environmental shifts, and topography can prove to be dispersal barriers but are often semipermeable. Evidence of historical events such as points of faunal origin and climatic fluctuations are also evident in contemporary biogeographic ranges. Continued synthetic analysis, database construction, theoretical advancement and field sampling will be required to further refine hypotheses regarding deep-sea biogeography.},

abstract = {The bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, is one of very few animals that, through vocal learning, can invent novel acoustic signals and copy whistles of conspecifics. Furthermore, receivers can extract identity information from the invented part of whistles. In captivity, dolphins use such signature whistles while separated from the rest of their group. However, little is known about how they use them at sea. If signature whistles are the main vehicle to transmit identity information, then dolphins should exchange these whistles in contexts where groups or individuals join. We used passive acoustic localization during focal boat follows to observe signature whistle use in the wild. We found that stereotypic whistle exchanges occurred primarily when groups of dolphins met and joined at sea. A sequence analysis verified that most of the whistles used during joins were signature whistles. Whistle matching or copying was not observed in any of the joins. The data show that signature whistle exchanges are a significant part of a greeting sequence that allows dolphins to identify conspecifics when encountering them in the wild.},

abstract = {Meso- and submesoscales (fronts, eddies, filaments) in surface ocean flow have a crucial influence on marine ecosystems. Their dynamics partly control the foraging behavior and the displacement of marine top predators (tuna, birds, turtles, and cetaceans). In this work we focus on the role of submesoscale structures in the Mozambique Channel in the distribution of a marine predator, the Great Frigatebird. Using a newly developed dynamic concept, the finite-size Lyapunov exponent (FSLE), we identified Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) present in the surface flow in the channel over a 2-month observation period (August and September 2003). By comparing seabird satellite positions with LCS locations, we demonstrate that frigatebirds track precisely these structures in the Mozambique Channel, providing the first evidence that a top predator is able to track these FSLE ridges to locate food patches. After comparing bird positions during long and short trips and different parts of these trips, we propose several hypotheses to understand how frigatebirds can follow these LCSs. The birds might use visual and/or olfactory cues and/or atmospheric current changes over the structures to move along these biologic corridors. The birds being often associated with tuna schools around foraging areas, a thorough comprehension of their foraging behavior and movement during the breeding season is crucial not only to seabird ecology but also to an appropriate ecosystemic approach to fisheries in the channel.},

abstract = {Low-frequency acoustic signals generated by baleen whales can propagate over vast distances, making the assignment of calls to specific individuals problematic. Here we report the novel use of acoustic recording tags equipped with high-resolution accelerometers to detect vibrations on the surface of two tagged fin whales that directly match the timing of recorded acoustic signals. A tag deployed on a buoy in the vicinity of calling fin whales, and a recording from a tag that had just fallen off of a whale, were able to detect calls acoustically but did not record corresponding accelerometer signals that were measured on calling individuals. Across the hundreds of calls measured on two tagged fin whales, the accelerometer response was generally anisotropic across all three axes, appeared to depend on tag placement, and increased with the level of received sound. These data demonstrate that high-sample-rate accelerometry can provide important insights into the acoustic behavior of baleen whales that communicate at low frequencies. This method helps identify vocalizing whales, which in turn enables the quantification of call rates, a fundamental component of models used to estimate baleen whale abundance and distribution from passive acoustic monitoring.},

abstract = {North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) make a short, distinctive broadband sound that is produced internally called a Gunshot sound. This sound has been recorded in the Bay of Fundy, Canada from both single whales (n=9) and social surface active groups (n=49). Those single whales producing Gunshot sounds whose sex could be determined (n=9) were all mature males. Gunshot sounds were produced as part of a stereotyped behavioral sequence by these individuals, including frequent head-lifts and flipper slapping at the surface. In surface active groups, Gunshot sounds were commonly recorded when males were present in the group. The rate of production of Gunshot sounds was weakly correlated with the total number of males present in the group. Given the behavioral context of Gunshot sound production, and production of the sound only by male whales, Gunshots may function in a reproductive context as an advertisement signal to attract females, an agonistic signal directed toward other males, or a combination of the two functions.},

Field trials were conducted. between 22 July and 31 August 2000 in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Echolocation clicks were continuously monitored with Porpoise Echolocation Detectors (PODs). Commercial and experimental (chemically enhanced) gill nets were set for groundfish in water depths from 100 to 130 m. Echolocation occurrence (the proportion of 10 s intervals during which clicks were detected) and echolocation rate (the number of clicks h(-1)) were measured. The PODs varied in their detection ability, so comparisons between commercial and enhanced nets were made with individual PODs. Neither echolocation rate nor occurrence differed with net type for any POD. Significantly more echolocation was detected during the day than at night. Echolocation rate and echolocation occurrence varied with depth and location, possibly reflecting concomitant variation in the relative abundance of porpoises and/or their prey: We conclude that porpoises do not respond to the acoustic reflectivity of the modified nets. Rather, the effectiveness of these nets is apparently due to other factors, such as their physical properties, particularly their stiffness.},

abstract = {In several publications, it was shown that echolocation sound generation in the nasal (epicranial) complex of toothed whales (Odontoceti) is pneumatically driven. Modern hypotheses consider the larynx and its surrounding musculature to produce the initial air pressure: (a) contraction of the strong pipelike palatopharyngeal sphincter muscle complex, which connects the choanae with the epiglottic spout of the larynx, should provide much of the power for this process and (b) muscles suspending the larynx/hyoid complex from the skull base and the mandibles may support these pistonlike laryngeal movements. Here, we describe the morphology and topography of the larynx, the hyoid apparatus, and the relevant musculature in the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) with respect to odontocete vocalization and respiration. We demonstrate that the hyoid apparatus, reminiscent of a ldquoswinging cage,rdquo may not only be a stable framework in which the larynx can move but should support laryngeal actions by its own movements. Rostrocaudal relocations of the hyoid apparatus may thus support pistonlike actions of the larynx creating air flow into the nasal complex for sound production. The lift of the hyoid apparatus with the thick larynx in the direction of the skull base may squeeze the pharynx in the region of the piriform recesses and thus help to secure the (waterproof) tracheochoanal connection during respiration when the palatopharyngeal sphincter cannot be contracted maximally, because the air passage must remain open at the epiglottic spout.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to analyse the structure, social contexts, and individual variation of South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) airborne vocal communication during the breeding season. This is the first comprehensive analysis of the vocal repertoire of this species. Since breeding colonies are complex acoustic environments, we expect that male, female, and pup vocalizations would show individuality, and that individual variation would rely on several acoustic traits. We identified four calls for adult males: high pitched call or HPC (aggressive interactions, such as attack and retreat displays, and fights), bark (aggressive interactions, territory establishment, and usually combined with growls), growl (male-female interactions), and exhalation (after agonistic encounters); and two for adult females: mother primary call or MPC (female-pup interactions, such as after birth, during pup separation, and pup development), and grunt (agonistic interactions between females). Juveniles vocalized yearling primary calls or YPC (searching for their mothers or after being threatened by females), pups gave pup primary calls or PPC (in response to MPCs, when hungry, searching for their mothers, if nursing was interrupted, or when frying to nurse). Our results suggest that male's HPC and bark, female's MPC, and pup's PPC have acoustic features that support individuality. These calls are associated with contexts in which recognition of neighbours (HPC and bark) or relatives (MPC and PPC) may confer a relative advantage in reproductive performance. Individual variation depended on frequency, temporal, and intensity traits; such multi-trait individuality could be regarded as an adaptation to colonial life to overcome the high noise levels within pinniped breeding colonies.},

abstract = {Broadband acoustic backscattering measurements, advanced high-resolution imaging of fish morphology using CT scans and phase-contrast x rays (in addition to traditional x rays), and associated scattering modeling using the images have been conducted involving alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), a swimbladder-bearing fish. A greater-than-octave bandwidth (40-95 kHz) signal was used to insonify live, individual, adult alewife that were tethered while being rotated in 1-deg increments over all angles in two planes of rotation (lateral and dorsal/ventral). These data, in addition to providing the orientation dependence of the scattering over a continuous band of frequencies, were also used (after pulse. compression) to identify dominant scattering features of the fish (including the skull and swimbladder). The x-ray and CT scan images of the swimbladder were digitized and incorporated into two scattering models: (1) Kirchhoff-ray mode (KRM) model [Clay and Home, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 96, 1661-1668 (1994)] and (2) conformal-mapping-based Fourier matching method (FMM), which has recently been extended to finite-length bodies [Reeder and Stanton, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 116. 729-746 (2004)]. Comparisons between the scattering predictions and data demonstrate the utility of the CT scan imagery for use in scattering models, as it provided a means for rapidly and noninvasively measuring the fish morphology in three dimensions and at high resolution. In addition to further validation of the KRM model, the potential of the new FMM formulation was demonstrated, which is a versatile approach, valid over a wide range of shapes, all frequencies and all angles of orientation.

In this study, we used auditory brainstem response (ABR) to assess the pressure and particle acceleration thresholds of six sciaenid fishes commonly found in Chesapeake Bay, eastern USA: weakfish (Cynoscion regalis), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) and northern kingfish (Menticirrhus saxatilis). Experimental subjects were presented with pure 10 ms tone bursts in 100 Hz steps from 100 Hz to 1.2 kHz using an airborne speaker. Sound stimuli, monitored with a hydrophone and geophone, contained both pressure and particle motion components. Sound pressure and particle acceleration thresholds varied significantly among species and between frequencies; audiograms were notably flatter for acceleration than pressure at low frequencies. Thresholds of species with diverticulae projecting anteriorly from their swim bladders (weakfish, spotted seatrout, and Atlantic croaker) were typically but not significantly lower than those of species lacking such projections (red drum, spot, northern kingfish). Sciaenids were most sensitive at low frequencies that overlap the peak frequencies of their vocalizations. Auditory thresholds of these species were used to estimate idealized propagation distances of sciaenid vocalizations in coastal and estuarine environments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In aggressive mimicry, a predator or parasite imitates a signal of another species in order to exploit the recipient of the signal. Some of the most remarkable examples of aggressive mimicry involve exploitation of a complex signal-response system by an unrelated predator species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have found that predatory Chlorobalius leucoviridis katydids (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) can attract male cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) by imitating the species-specific wing-flick replies of sexually receptive female cicadas. This aggressive mimicry is accomplished both acoustically, with tegminal clicks, and visually, with synchronized body jerks. Remarkably, the katydids respond effectively to a variety of complex, species-specific Cicadettini songs, including songs of many cicada species that the predator has never encountered. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We propose that the versatility of aggressive mimicry in C. leucoviridis is accomplished by exploiting general design elements common to the songs of many acoustically signaling insects that use duets in pair-formation. Consideration of the mechanism of versatile mimicry in C. leucoviridis may illuminate processes driving the evolution of insect acoustic signals, which play a central role in reproductive isolation of populations and the formation of species.},

abstract = {Noise levels in the ocean are increasing and are expected to affect marine mammals. To examine the auditory effects of noise on odontocetes, a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) was exposed to octave-band noise (4-8 kHz) of varying durations ({\textless}2-30 min) and sound pressures (130-178 dB re 1 microPa). Temporary threshold shift (TTS) occurrence was quantified in an effort to (i) determine the sound exposure levels (SELs) (dB re 1 microPa(2) s) that induce TTS and (ii) develop a model to predict TTS onset. Hearing thresholds were measured using auditory evoked potentials. If SEL was kept constant, significant shifts were induced by longer duration exposures but not for shorter exposures. Higher SELs were required to induce shifts in shorter duration exposures. The results did not support an equal-energy model to predict TTS onset. Rather, a logarithmic algorithm, which increased in sound energy as exposure duration decreased, was a better predictor of TTS. Recovery to baseline hearing thresholds was also logarithmic (approximately -1.8 dB/doubling of time) but indicated variability including faster recovery rates after greater shifts and longer recoveries necessary after longer duration exposures. The data reflected the complexity of TTS in mammals that should be taken into account when predicting odontocete TTS.},

abstract = {Testing that random effects are zero is difficult, because the null hypothesis restricts the corresponding variance parameter to the edge of the feasible parameter space. In the context of generalized linear mixed models, this paper exploits the link between random effects and penalized regression to develop a simple test for a zero effect. The idea is to treat the variance components not being tested as fixed at their estimates and then to express the likelihood ratio as a readily computed quadratic form in the predicted values of the random effects. Under the null hypothesis this has the distribution of a weighted sum of squares of independent standard normal random variables. The test can be used with generalized linear mixed models, including those estimated by penalized quasilikelihood.},

abstract = {Charles Darwin posited that secondary sexual characteristics result from competition to attract mates. In male songbirds, specialized vocalizations represent secondary sexual characteristics of particular importance because females prefer songs at specific frequencies, amplitudes, and duration. For birds living in human-dominated landscapes, historic selection for song characteristics that convey fitness may compete with novel selective pressures from anthropogenic noise. Here we show that black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) use shorter, higher-frequency songs when traffic noise is high, and longer, lower-frequency songs when noise abates. We suggest that chickadees balance opposing selective pressures by use low-frequency songs to preserve vocal characteristics of dominance that repel competitors and attract females, and high frequency songs to increase song transmission when their environment is noisy. The remarkable vocal flexibility exhibited by chickadees may be one reason that they thrive in urban environments, and such flexibility may also support subsequent genetic adaptation to an increasingly urbanized world.},

abstract = {Offshore orientation in marine mammals is still a mystery. For visual orientation during night-time foraging and travelling in the open seas, seals cannot rely on distant terrestrial landmarks, and thus might use celestial cues as repeatedly shown for nocturnally migrating birds. Although seals detect enough stars to probably allow for astronavigation, it was unclear whether they can orient by the night sky. The widely accepted cognitive mechanism for bird night-time orientation by celestial cues is a time-independent star compass with learned geometrical star configurations used to pinpoint north as the rotational centre of the starry sky while there is no conclusive evidence for a time-compensated star compass or true star navigation. Here, we present results for two harbour seals orienting in a custom made swimming planetarium. Both seals learned to highly accurately identify a lodestar out of a pseudo-randomly oriented, realistic projection of the northern hemisphere night sky. Providing the first evidence for star orientation capability in a marine mammal, our seals' outstanding directional precision would allow them to steer by following lodestars of learned star courses, a celestial orientation mechanism that has been known to be used by Polynesian navigators but has not been considered for animals yet.},

Hard parts from an individual meal were recovered in an average of 3.8 ± 1.8 scats (range 1201310; mean ± SD). Overall, 57.7 ± 33.2{\%} of otoliths and 89.5 ± 15.5{\%} of squid beaks were recovered. Recovery rates varied, and prey with smaller, fragile otoliths were recovered in lesser quantities than prey with larger, robust otoliths. Recovery rates of all prey except pink salmon were improved by a mean of 31.7{\%} when all diagnostic structures were included in estimates. Estimated recovery of pink salmon was 9.5 times that fed seals based on the all-structure technique. Mean length reduction of recovered otoliths was 20.4 ± 10.1{\%}. Correction factors calculated from average length reduction improved length estimates for all fish species. Grade-specific length correction factors (gLCFs) reduced variability in all of the estimates and significantly improved estimates of prey with highly eroded otoliths including Pacific hake and shortbelly rockfish. The Biomass Reconstruction (BR) model accurately predicted biomass consumption within 4{\%} of known consumption, whereas estimates based on frequency of occurrence were inaccurate.},

These signals had higher frequencies, broader bandwidths, longer pulse durations and shorter inter-pulse intervals than previously described pulses of Blainville's, Cuvier's and Gervais' beaked whales [Zimmer et al. (2005). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 117, 3919-3927; Johnson et al. (2006). J. Exp. Biol. 209, 5038-5050; Gillespie et al. (2009). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 125, 3428-3433]. They were distinctly different temporally and spectrally from the unknown beaked whale at Cross Seamount, HI [McDonald et al. (2009). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 125, 624-627]. Genetics on beaked whale specimens found at Palmyra Atoll suggest the presence of a poorly known beaked whale species. Mesoplodon sp. might be the source of the FM pulses described in this paper. The Palmyra Atoll FM pulse peak frequency was at 44 kHz with a -10 dB bandwidth of 26 kHz. Mean pulse duration was 355 mus and inter-pulse interval was 225 ms, with a bimodal distribution. Buzz sequences were detected with inter-pulse intervals below 20 ms and unmodulated spectra, with about 20 dB lower amplitude than prior FM pulses. These clicks had a 39 kHz bandwidth (-10 dB), peak frequency at 37 kHz, click duration 155 mus, and inter-click interval between 4 and 10 ms.},

abstract = {Calls from North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica) were recorded in the eastern Bering Sea during a visual and acoustic survey aboard the US Coast Guard buoy tender Sweetbrier, in July 1999. Calls were commonly detected to 20km, and in one case approximately 30km, via deployment of arrays of directional sonobuoys. Acoustic detections (clusters of right whale calls separated by time and location) numbered 26, but only five right whales were seen. Only one right whale produced calls while under visual observation. The types of calls recorded from North Pacific right whales were similar in duration and frequency to calls recorded from right whales in the South Atlantic. The predominant call type (85{\%}; 436 of 511 calls) was the ‘up' call, a signal sweeping from about 90Hz to 150Hz in 0.7s. Two call types are described as ‘down' and ‘constant' calls, based upon nomenclature established for southern right whales (Eubalaena australis). One call type, the ‘down-up' was unique to the North Pacific repertoire. Right whales commonly produced calls in series lasting several minutes and then became silent for an hour or more, with some animals not calling for periods of at least four hours. Other cetaceans detected acoustically by ‘random' sonobuoy deployments during the cruise included fin whales (19 times), killer whales (3 times) and sperm whales (once).},

abstract = {This paper uses capillary electrophoresis to follow a globular metalloprotein-bovine carbonic anhydrase II (BCA, EC 4.2.1.1)-on unfolding upon treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and refolding upon removal of SDS, both in the presence and the absence of its Zn(II) cofactor. This research demonstrates that the Zn(II) cofactor is not required for refolding into a nativelike conformation, does not remain associated with the unfolded protein, and does not significantly change the rate of refolding. The presence of the Zn(II) cofactor, however, does increase the total amount of recovered protein by a factor of 2. Capillary electrophoresis could distinguish between native and denatured protein, based on the difference in electrophoretic mobility between the native protein and the aggregate of denatured protein and SDS. In addition, the active site was probed by observing binding of BCA to a charged arylsulfonamide using affinity capillary electrophoresis. These studies provide a foundation for future physical-organic studies using BCA as a model to examine interactions between proteins and SDS.},

abstract = {In situ swimming speed and swimming behaviour of dielly migrating planktivorous fish were studied at a 120-m-deep location. Acoustic target tracking was performed using a hull-mounted transducer and submersible transducers located on the sea bottom and free hanging in the water column. The original data displayed a relationship between distance to transducer and swimming speed. A simplistic smoother applied during post-processing, appeared to break this relationship. Target tracking thus provided robust results on in situ swimming behaviour throughout the water column. Swimming speeds of deep-living fish, mainly Norway pout (Trisopterus esmarkii) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus), were highest during the day (speeds centred around 14-16 cm center dot s(-1)) and decreased somewhat by night (modes around 10-11 cm center dot s(-1)). Fish in the upper 10-30 m swam somewhat faster (speeds ranging from 16 to 24 cm center dot s(-1)). Fish in the upper layer at night were mainly Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), sprat (Sprattus sprattus), and whiting. We ascribe the reduction of swimming speed in deep-living fish at night to a switch from visual feeding during daytime to nonvisual feeding by night. We suggest that shallow-living fish could forage visually even by night. Most tracks were fairly short, but some long tracks unveiled elaborate swimming paths as well as cyclic swimming behaviour.},

abstract = {Our current knowledge on sound detection in fishes is mainly based on data acquired under quiet laboratory conditions. However, it is important to relate auditory thresholds to background noise in order to determine the signal-detecting abilities of animals in the natural environment. We investigated the influence of two noise levels within the naturally occurring range on the auditory sensitivity of two hearing specialists (otophysines) and a hearing generalist. Audiograms of the goldfish Carassius auratus, the lined Raphael catfish Platydoras costatus and the pumpkinseed sunfish Lepomis gibbosus (hearing generalist) were determined between 200 and 4000 Hz (100-800 Hz for L. gibbosus) under laboratory conditions and under continuous white noise by recording auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). Baseline thresholds showed greatest hearing sensitivity around 500 Hz in goldfish and catfish and at 100 Hz in the sunfish. Continuous white noise of 110 dB RMS elevated the thresholds by 15-20 dB in C. auratus and by 4-22 dB in P. costatus. White noise of 130 dB RMS elevated overall hearing thresholds significantly in the otophysines by 23-44 dB. In the goldfish, threshold did not shift at 4 kHz. In contrast, auditory thresholds in the sunfish declined only at the higher noise level by 7-11 dB. Our data show that the AEP recording technique is suitable for studying masking in fishes, and that the occurrence and degree of the threshold shift (masking) depend on the hearing sensitivity of fishes, the frequency, and noise levels tested. The results indicate that acoustic communication and orientation of fishes, in particular of hearing specialists, are limited by noise regimes in their environment.},

Using a simple dynamic biomass production model we show that MSY can be identified from a long time series of multi-stock data at a regional scale in the presence of species interactions and environmental change. It suggests that MSY is robust and calculable in a multispecies environment, offering a realistic reference point for fishery management. Furthermore, the demonstration of the existence of MSY shows that it is more than a purely theoretical concept. There has been an improvement in the status of stocks in the Northeast Atlantic, but our analysis suggests further reductions in fishing effort would improve long-term yields.},

Each step and turn is assigned to one of a number of random walks, each characteristic of a different behavioral state. Behavioral state assignments may be inferred purely from movement data or may include the habitat type in which the animals are located. Switching between different behavioral states may be modeled explicitly using a state transition matrix estimated directly from data, or switching probabilities may take into account the proximity of animals to landscape features. Model fitting is undertaken within a Bayesian framework using the WinBUGS software.

abstract = {Multiple factors simultaneously affect the spiking activity of individual neurons. Determining the effects and relative importance of these factors is a challenging problem in neurophysiology. We propose a statistical framework based on the point process likelihood function to relate a neuron's spiking probability to three typical covariates: the neuron's own spiking history, concurrent ensemble activity, and extrinsic covariates such as stimuli or behavior. The framework uses parametric models of the conditional intensity function to define a neuron's spiking probability in terms of the covariates. The discrete time likelihood function for point processes is used to carry out model fitting and model analysis. We show that, by modeling the logarithm of the conditional intensity function as a linear combination of functions of the covariates, the discrete time point process likelihood function is readily analyzed in the generalized linear model (GLM) framework. We illustrate our approach for both GLM and non-GLM likelihood functions using simulated data and multivariate single-unit activity data simultaneously recorded from the motor cortex of a monkey performing a visuomotor pursuit-tracking task. The point process framework provides a flexible, computationally efficient approach for maximum likelihood estimation, goodness-of-fit assessment, residual analysis, model selection, and neural decoding. The framework thus allows for the formulation and analysis of point process models of neural spiking activity that readily capture the simultaneous effects of multiple covariates and enables the assessment of their relative importance.},

abstract = {Acoustic target strengths (TSalpha) of dispersed capelin (Mallotus villosus) were assessed in situ in six experiments conducted in June from 1992 to 1996 in Newfoundland waters. Calibrated dual-beam (120, 49, and 38 kHz) and split-beam (38 kHz) echo-sounders were used. A general linear model indicated that method (dual- or split-beam), fish density, and time of day relative to light conditions had no effect on TSalpha (p's{\textgreater}0.05). TSalpha at 120 kHz was 1 dB less than at 38 and 49 kHz (p{\textless}0.05). Capelin length and weight were the major determinants of TSalpha (p's{\textless}0.05). A length based model for 38 and 49 kHz was TSalpha =20 Log L - 73.1 (- 73.8 to - 72.4; R-2=0.69). However, fish in better condition had lower TSalpha independent of length. A model including the effects of length and weight was TSalpha=68.6 log L (cm) - 15.2 log W (kg) - 157.3 (R-2 =0.80). The effect of condition was greater on TSalpha assessed by weight: TSalpha kg(-1)=69.7 log L - 25.5 log W (kg) - 159.0 (R-2=0.71; p's{\textless}0.05). These results are compared to previous work on TSalpha of capelin and similar species. (C) 1998 international Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {Acoustic surveys can have several advantages over visual methods in surveys of cetaceans, although verification is required that novel techniques are effective. The T-POD is an autonomous acoustic data logger with inbuilt filters that can be set to match the click characteristics of the target species. We tested the performance of the T-POD for detecting Hector's dolphins at Flea Bay, Banks Peninsula, New Zealand. Simultaneous visual surveys were conducted from a hillside overlooking the bay, with distances between the T-POD and dolphins measured using a theodolite. Wideband sound recordings confirmed that T-POD detections were echolocation clicks made by Hector's dolphins. Detection probability and click train detection rate decreased with increasing distance, with no detections made beyond 500 m. By fitting detection functions to the probability of detection versus distance we showed that the T-POD effectively detected all dolphin groups within a radius Of 198-239 m, depending on the click train categories utilized. The T-POD shows considerable promise as a tool for passive acoustic surveys of Hector's dolphins, with possible applications in studies of distribution, habitat use and echolocation behaviour.},

abstract = {Acoustic signaling systems that permit individual recognition are described in an increasing number of species. Evolutionary logic predicts that the efficiency of these signatures is related to the possibilities for confusion. To test this "signature adaptation" hypothesis, one needs a standardized method to estimate and compare the efficiency of different signatures. Beecher [Am. Zool. 22, 477-490 (1989)] developed such a method by comparing scalar parameters extracted from the signals. However, vocal signatures frequently consist in the evolution of one parameter against one other, which are not comparable through Beecher's method. Here we present a method to estimate the efficiency of modulated signatures. A signature's efficiency is given by its information capacity (Hm), derived from Shannon's information theory. The measure of Hm is based on an analysis of variance and uses the Euclidian distances between the signature's contours in the population. To validate our method, simulated datasets of modulated contours were used. The predicted efficiency of those signatures, estimated from Hm, was strongly correlated to its actual efficiency given by two classification methods: a discriminant analysis and a classification by human observers. Being also untied to sample size, Hm therefore allows comparing objectively vocal, but also visual and olfactory signatures.},

abstract = {Several authors suggest that dolphins use information obtained by eavesdropping on echoes from sonar signals of conspecifics, but there is little evidence that this strategy is used by dolphins in the wild. Travelling rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis) either exhibit asynchronous movements or an extremely synchronized swimming behaviour in tight formations, which we expect to facilitate eavesdropping. Therefore, we determined, whether either one or more dolphins were echolocating in subgroups that were travelling with asynchronous and synchronized movements. Since, the number of recording sequences in which more than one animal produced sonar signals was significantly lower during synchronized travel, we conclude that the other members of a subgroup might get information on targets ahead by eavesdropping. Synchronized swimming in tight formations might be an energetic adaptation for travelling in a pelagic dolphin species that facilitates eavesdropping.},

A synthesized tone was created out of 20 different 150 ms sounds, each separated by a 50 ms period of silence; the acoustic energy of each of the 20 sounds was concentrated between 200–400 Hz, and each sound included frequency modulation. The trial stimuli were presented to western diamondback rattlesnakes Crotalus atrox at a level 5–10 dB above their perception threshold. Four significant behavioural responses were observed upon stimulus presentation: cessation of body movements, reduction or cessation of tongue flicking, rapid jerks of the head and rattling. At least one significant behavioural response was observed in 92{\%} of the behavioural trials. This study provides the first experimental evidence that snakes can respond behaviourally to airborne sounds.},

abstract = {The significance of vessel avoidance behaviour for the acoustic abundance estimation of Norwegian spring spawning herring has been investigated during acoustic surveys in the herring wintering area in Northern Norway. The relative variation in echo energy values measured from a submerged 38 kHz transducer during passage of a survey vessel was analysed. All systematic changes in acoustic densities around the time of passing were interpreted as avoidance reactions and the most important behavioural changes are believed to be body tilting and vertical and horizontal swimming. A quantification of the loss of echo energy due to vessel avoidance is presented. Experiments were grouped into nighttime and daytime experiments. While a considerable drop in echo energy around the time of passage was observed at night, insignificant loss in echo energy was found during the day. There was a high degree of variation between experiments, but a general reaction pattern was identified in all the nighttime experiments. The magnitude of the vessel avoidance reaction was highly dependent on depth. Coefficients that quantified avoidance reactions were calculated for separate depth layers between 40 and 400 m. Between 40 and 100 m depth, 24 nighttime experiments showed a mean loss of echo energy of 84{\%}. The effect of avoidance reactions faded out below 100 m, but was observed down to 150 m at night. Below 150 m no significant avoidance reaction was seen, and this may explain the absence of avoidance reaction during the day when the main part of the biomass was distributed below 150 m. Consequences for uncertainty in abundance estimation are discussed, and a rough estimate of the acoustic density lost during acoustic surveys in the wintering area is made.},

abstract = {Animals may forage using different currencies depending on whether time minimization or energy maximization is more pertinent at the time. Assessment of net energy acquisition requires detailed information on instantaneous activity-specific power use, which varies according to animal performance, being influenced, for example, by speed and prey loading, and which has not been measured before in wild animals. We used a new proxy for instantaneous energy expenditure (overall dynamic body acceleration), to quantify foraging effort in a model species, the imperial shag , during diving. Power costs varied nonlinearly with depth exploited owing to depth-related buoyancy. Consequently, solutions for maximizing the gross rate of gain and energetic efficiency differed for dives to any given depth. Dive effort in free-ranging imperial shags measured during the breeding season was consistent with a strategy to maximize the gross rate of energy gain. We suggest that the divergence of time and energy costs with dive depth has implications for the measurement of dive efficiency across diverse diving taxa.},

abstract = {Abstract  Adult Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) exhibit site fidelity to where they first breed but juveniles, and perhaps transient adult males, may disperse from their natal location. If there is mixing between adjacent breeding groups, we would expect that common vocalizations would exhibit clinal patterns. Underwater Trill vocalizations of male Weddell seals at Mawson, Davis, Casey, McMurdo Sound, Neumayer and Drescher Inlet separated by ca. 500 to {\textgreater}9,000 km, were examined for evidence of clinal variation. Trills are only emitted by males and have a known territorial defense function. Trills from Davis and Mawson, ca. 630 km apart, were distinct from each other and exhibited the greatest number of unique frequency contour patterns. The acoustic features (duration, waveform, frequency contour) of Trills from Neumayer and Drescher Inlet, ca. 500 km apart, were more distinct from each other than they were from the other four locations. General Discriminant Analysis and Classification Tree Analysis correctly classified 65.8 and 76.9{\%} of the Trills to the correct location. The classification errors assigned more locations to sites {\textgreater}630 km away than to nearest neighbours. Weddell seal Trills exhibit geographic variation but there is no evidence of a clinal pattern. This suggests that males remain close to single breeding areas throughout their lifetime.},

In the context of generalized linear mixed models, this paper exploits the link between random effects and penalized regression to develop a simple test for a zero effect. The idea is to treat the variance components not being tested as fixed at their estimates and then to express the likelihood ratio as a readily computed quadratic form in the predicted values of the random effects. Under the null hypothesis this has the distribution of a weighted sum of squares of independent standard normal random variables. The test can be used with generalized linear mixed models, including those estimated by penalized quasilikelihood.},

abstract = {Sounds provide important signals for inter- and intraspecific communication in fishes, but few studies examine fish acoustic behavior in the context of coevolution of sound production and hearing ability within a species. This study characterizes the acoustic behavior in a reproductive population of the Hawaiian sergeant fish, Abudefduf abdominalis, and compares acoustic features to hearing ability, measured by the auditory evoked potential (AEP) technique. Sergeant fish produce sounds at close distances to the intended receiver ([{\textless}=]1-2 body lengths), with different pulse characteristics that are associated primarily with aggression, nest preparation and courtship-female-visit behaviors. Energy peaks of all sounds were between 90 and 380 Hz, whereas courtship-visit sounds had a pulse repetition rate of 125 Hz with harmonic intervals up to 1 kHz. AEP threshold, which is probably higher than the behavioral threshold, indicates best sensitivity at low frequencies (95-240 Hz), with the lowest threshold at 125 Hz (123-127 dBrms re: 1 {\{}micro{\}}Pa). Thus, sound production and hearing in A. abdominalis are closely matched in the frequency domain and are useful for courtship and mating at close distances. Measured hearing thresholds did not differ among males and females during spawning or non-spawning periods, which indicates a lack of sex differences and seasonal variation in hearing capabilities. These data provide the first evidence that Abudefduf uses true acoustic communication on a level similar to that of both more derived (e.g. Dascyllus, Chromis) and more basal (e.g. Stegastes) soniferous pomacentrids. This correlation between sound production and hearing ability is consistent with the sensory drive model of signal evolution in which the sender and receiver systems coevolve within the constraints of the environment to maximize information transfer of acoustic signals.},

abstract = {Noise pollution from human traffic networks and industrial activity impacts vast areas of our planet. While anthropogenic noise effects on animal communication are well documented, we have very limited understanding of noise impact on more complex ecosystem processes, such as predator{\^{a}}€“prey interactions, albeit urgently needed to devise mitigation measures. Here, we show that traffic noise decreases the foraging efficiency of an acoustic predator, the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis). These bats feed on large, ground-running arthropods that they find by listening to their faint rustling sounds. We measured the bats' foraging performance on a continuous scale of acoustically simulated highway distances in a behavioural experiment, designed to rule out confounding factors such as general noise avoidance. Successful foraging bouts decreased and search time drastically increased with proximity to the highway. At 7.5 m to the road, search time was increased by a factor of five. From this increase, we predict a 25-fold decrease in surveyed ground area and thus in foraging efficiency for a wild bat. As most of the bats' prey are predators themselves, the noise impact on the bats' foraging performance will have complex effects on the food web and ultimately on the ecosystem stability. Similar scenarios apply to other ecologically important and highly protected acoustic predators, e.g. owls. Our study provides the empirical basis for quantitative predictions of anthropogenic noise impacts on ecosystem processes. It highlights that an understanding of the effects of noise emissions and other forms of {\^{a}}€˜sensory pollution{\^{a}}€™ are crucially important for the assessment of environmental impact of human activities.},

Highest densities of small delphinids were associated with the shelf break, in particular in two hotspots located in the north and the south of the bay. Using ship-based data, we found strong spatial segregation between common and bottlenose dolphins in spring, with common dolphins associated with coastal areas (and especially river plumes) and bottlenose dolphins on the outer shelf and the shelf break. Assuming a detection probability of 1, a strip-transect abundance estimate for the small delphinid community was obtained in August 2002 with 56 500 (95{\%} Cl 29 100-90 400), but relative abundance varied across months.},

abstract = {We recorded a series of 34 fin whale vocalizations using four calibrated hydrophones in a towed array. The whale's location was determined using arrival-time differences of each call at the hydrophones. The recordings showed evidence of interference between signals propagating along direct and surface-reflected paths (the "Lloyd Mirror"). We made preliminary estimates of source level (SL) using a spherical spreading model of transmission loss. We then applied a conservative correction for the effect of interference by subtracting the maximum possible signal enhancement from the preliminary SL estimate. These adjusted spherical spreading estimates had a median of 171 dB re 1 03BCPa at 1 m, with a range of 1592013184 dB. These are the first SL estimates that explicitly attempt to correct for possible interference effects. We also propose a method that simultaneously estimates SL and source depth by fitting a Lloyd Mirror transmission loss curve to the measured received level, known receiver depth, and source-to-receiver range. Attempts to apply this method to the present data set yielded inconsistent results, probably because of the small number of hydrophones available. With more hydrophones in the interference field, this new method should produce reliable estimates of SL and depth of vocalizing whales.},

abstract = {Food and predators are thought to have independent effects on avian reproductive success. Several studies have now shown that extra food can reduce nest predation rates. Most hypotheses suggest that this is due to changes in adult and/or nestling behaviour. A critical test as to whether behaviour is key, is to examine when predation events occur for birds with and without extra food. If behaviour is important, extra food should lead to fewer nest predation events during the day, when birds are active, but have no effect at night. We conducted a food supplementation experiment on song sparrows and tested for food effects on timing of nest predation events, adult antipredator behaviour and nestling begging behaviour. Food supplementation significantly reduced the relative frequency of daytime nest predation especially during incubation. During incubation, fed females had shorter foraging bouts and longer bouts on the nest, and these behaviours were associated with a reduced probability of being preyed upon. During brooding, we found trends (P {\textless} 0.1) towards lower daytime predation and greater adult nest attendance for fed birds than for unfed birds, but nestling begging did not differ with food treatment. Our results show that food availability does influence nest predation through its effect on antipredator behaviour. We highlight the importance of examining adult behaviour and vulnerability to predation at both stages of the nesting period because behavioural changes with extra food were extreme at the egg stage and were more effective at reducing nest predation than were behavioural changes at the nestling stage.

Auditory thresholds were obtained from 2 to 31.5 kHz. Compared to the hearing thresholds of other dolphins as well as of amphibian mammals, the sensitivity to airborne sound of the test subject is low from 2 to 8 kHz, with the highest threshold at 4 kHz. Thresholds at 16 and 31.5 kHz reveal a sharp increase in hearing sensitivity. Thus, although not obtained in this study, the upper aerial hearing limit is in the ultrasonic range. A comparison of the present data with the underwater audiogram of the same test subject referred to sound intensity indicates that the sensitivity of Sotalia to underwater sound is generally better than to airborne sound.

abstract = {Otophysine fish possess Weberian ossicles, which connect the swimbladder to the inner ear and improve hearing ability. There is a high diversity in the morphology of the swimbladder and Weberian apparatus in catfishes, which might affect hearing. We have examined these structures in representatives of six families with large, single bladders (Ariidae, Auchenipteridae, Heptapteridae, Malapteruridae, Mochokidae, Pseudopimelodidae) and five subfamilies from two families (Callichthyidae, Loricariidae) having small, paired, encapsulated bladders. We tested their hearing abilities utilizing the non-invasive auditory evoked potential recording technique. Species with single, non-encapsulated, free airbladders possess one, three or four ossicles, whereas species with encapsulated bladders possess one or two. The relative sizes of the bladders and ossicles were significantly smaller in the latter group. All species were able to detect sound stimuli between 50 Hz and 5 kHz. Interspecific differences in hearing sensitivity varied at most by 24 dB below 1 kHz, whilst this variation increased to more than 50 dB at higher frequencies. Catfishes with free bladders had lower thresholds above 1 kHz than those having encapsulated ones. The relative lengths of swimbladders and of ossicular chains were correlated with hearing sensitivity above 1 and 2 kHz, respectively. The number of ossicles affected hearing at 4 and 5 kHz. These results indicate that larger bladders and ossicles as well as higher ossicle numbers improve hearing ability at higher frequencies in catfishes. We furthermore assume that the tiny bladders have minimized their hydrostatic function but were not completely lost because of their auditory function.},

abstract = {To maximize fitness, animals must respond to a variety of processes that operate at different rates or timescales. Appropriate decisions could therefore involve complex interactions among these processes. For example, eiders wintering in the arctic sea ice must consider locomotion and physiology of diving for benthic invertebrates, digestive processing rate and a nonlinear decrease in profitability of diving as currents increase over the tidal cycle. Using a multi-scale dynamic modelling approach and continuous field observations of individuals, we demonstrate that the strategy that maximizes long-term energy gain involves resting during the most profitable foraging period (slack currents). These counterintuitive foraging patterns are an adaptive trade-off between multiple overlapping rate processes and cannot be explained by classical rate-maximizing optimization theory, which only considers a single timescale and predicts a constant rate of foraging. By reducing foraging and instead digesting during slack currents, eiders structure their activity in order to maximize long-term energetic gain over an entire tide cycle. This study reveals how counterintuitive patterns and a complex functional response can result from a simple trade-off among several overlapping rate processes, emphasizing the necessity of a multi-scale approach for understanding adaptive routines in the wild and evaluating mechanisms in ecological time series.},

The echolocation encounter rate, the minimum interclick interval per train, and the proportion of echolocation click trains with a minimum interclick interval below 10 msec were all significantly higher at night than during the day. The variation in echolocation rate implies that porpoises increased their echolocation rate and/or visited the depth of the POD more often at night than during the day.

abstract = {The widespread use of powerful, low-frequency air-gun pulses for seismic seabed exploration has raised concern about their potential negative effects on marine wildlife. Here, we quantify the sound exposure levels recorded on acoustic tags attached to eight sperm whales at ranges between 1.4 and 12.6 km from controlled air-gun array sources operated in the Gulf of Mexico. Due to multipath propagation, the animals were exposed to multiple sound pulses during each firing of the array with received levels of analyzed pulses falling between 131-167 dB re. 1 mu Pa (pp) [111 - 147 dB re. 1 mu Pa (rms) and 100- 135 dB re. 1 mu Pa-2 s] after compensation for hearing sensitivity using the M-weighting. Received levels varied widely with range and depth of the exposed animal precluding reliable estimation of exposure zones based on simple geometric spreading laws. When whales were close to the surface, the first arrivals of air-gun pulses contained most energy between 0.3 and 3 kHz, a frequency range well beyond the normal frequencies of interest in seismic exploration. Therefore air-gun arrays can generate significant sound energy at frequencies many octaves higher than the frequencies of interest for seismic exploration, which increases concern of the potential impact on odontocetes with poor low frequency hearing.

abstract = {Seamounts may influence the distribution of marine mammals through a combination of increased ocean mixing, enhanced local productivity and greater prey availability. To study the effects of seamounts on the presence and acoustic behaviour of cetaceans, we deployed a high-frequency acoustic recording package on the summit of Cross Seamount during April through October 2005. The most frequently detected cetacean vocalizations were echolocation sounds similar to those produced by ziphiid and mesoplodont beaked whales together with buzz-type signals consistent with prey-capture attempts. Beaked whale signals occurred almost entirely at night throughout the six-month deployment. Measurements of prey presence with a Simrad EK-60 fisheries acoustics echo sounder indicate that Cross Seamount may enhance local productivity in near-surface waters. Concentrations of micronekton were aggregated over the seamount in near-surface waters at night, and dense concentrations of nekton were detected across the surface of the summit. Our results suggest that seamounts may provide enhanced foraging opportunities for beaked whales during the night through a combination of increased productivity, vertical migrations by micronekton and local retention of prey. Furthermore, the summit of the seamount may act as a barrier against which whales concentrate prey.},

abstract = {Sound-and-orientation recording tags (DTAGs) were used to study 10 beaked whales of two poorly known species, Ziphius cavirostris (Zc) and Mesoplodon densirostris (Md). Acoustic behaviour in the deep foraging dives performed by both species (Zc: 28 dives by seven individuals; Md: 16 dives by three individuals) shows that they hunt by echolocation in deep water between 222 and 1885 m, attempting to capture about 30 prey/dive. This food source is so deep that the average foraging dives were deeper ( Zc: 1070 m; Md: 835 m) and longer (Zc: 58 min; Md: 47 min) than reported for any other air-breathing species. A series of shallower dives, containing no indications of foraging, followed most deep foraging dives. The average interval between deep foraging dives was 63 min for Zc and 92 min for Md. This long an interval may be required for beaked whales to recover from an oxygen debt accrued in the deep foraging dives, which last about twice the estimated aerobic dive limit. Recent reports of gas emboli in beaked whales stranded during naval sonar exercises have led to the hypothesis that their deep-diving may make them especially vulnerable to decompression. Using current models of breath-hold diving, we infer that their natural diving behaviour is inconsistent with known problems of acute nitrogen supersaturation and embolism. If the assumptions of these models are correct for beaked whales, then possible decompression problems are more likely to result from an abnormal behavioural response to sonar.},

abstract = {Pod-specific calling behaviour of resident killer whales has been shown to include: discrete call types not shared among pods, different production rates of shared call types, and differences in the detailed structure of shared call types. To investigate the mechanisms leading to pod-specific calling, we compared the repertoire and structure of calls produced by three different matrilineal units within the same pod, and described call features encoding matrilineal-unit distinctiveness. The three matrilineal units had different production rates of shared calls, including one call type used almost exclusively by one matrilineal unit. Cross-validated discriminant function analyses revealed matrilineal-unit distinctive structure in five of the six shared call types examined, with duration of the terminal component being the most distinctive feature for all call types containing a terminal component. Calls generally consist of low- and high-frequency components that may follow different time-frequency contours. In our sample, a particular high-frequency contour was consistently paired with a particular low-frequency contour, both contours had roughly equal overall variability, and each contained independent matrilineal-unit distinctive information. The only call type that did not differ structurally between matrilineal units is reportedly used more in interpod meetings than in intrapod contexts. The differences in calling behaviour between matrilineal units were similar in form to previously described differences between pods, although more subtle. These results suggest that pod-specific calling behaviour in resident killer whales arises primarily as a consequence of accumulated drift or divergence between highly cohesive matrilineal units as they gradually separate into different pods.},

abstract = {Vocalizations of individual Hawaiian monk seal pups, Monachus schauinslandi, do not have unique attributes that enable females to recognize their own offspring. Despite low aggregation density during pupping, aggressive encounters are common between females with pups. Fostering is prevalent and may reflect confusion over the identity of pups following aggressive encounters between females. All pup vocalizations were simple in structure and contained true harmonics. The coefficients of variation revealed considerable variance in vocalization structure within pups. Controlling for age, multivariate analyses of variance revealed significant. differences among pups in vocalization attributes. Significant developmental changes occurred in vocalization structure for some pups but not for others. Discriminant function analysis suggested that it would be difficult for females to distinguish between the vocalizations of pups. The results of experiments conducted in the field showed that females did not discriminate between filial and alien pups by voice. In addition, females tended not to foster pups that had vocalizations similar to those of their own offspring. Thus, females seem to be unable to recognize their pups by voice. The apparent lack of vocal recognition of pups may contribute to the high frequency of fostering in this species.},

abstract = {Traditionally, sperm whale clicks have been described as multipulsed, long duration, nondirectional signals of moderate intensity and with a spectrum peaking below 10 kHz. Such properties are counterindicative of a sonar function, and quite different from the properties of dolphin sonar clicks. Here, data are presented suggesting that the traditional view of sperm whale clicks is incomplete and derived from off-axis recordings of a highly directional source. A limited number of assumed on-axis clicks were recorded and found to be essentially monopulsed clicks, with durations of 100 micros, with a composite directionality index of 27 dB, with source levels up to 236 dB re: 1 microPa (rms), and with centroid frequencies of 15 kHz. Such clicks meet the requirements for long-range biosonar purposes. Data were obtained with a large-aperture, GPS-synchronized array in July 2000 in the Bleik Canyon off Vesteralen, Norway (69 degrees 28' N, 15 degrees 40' E). A total of 14 h of sound recordings was collected from five to ten independent, simultaneously operating recording units. The sound levels measured make sperm whale clicks by far the loudest of sounds recorded from any biological source. On-axis click properties support previous work proposing the nose of sperm whales to operate as a generator of sound.},

abstract = {Animal movement has been the focus on much theoretical and empirical work in ecology over the last 25 years. By studying the causes and consequences of individual movement, ecologists have gained greater insight into the behavior of individuals and the spatial dynamics of populations at increasingly higher levels of organization. In particular, ecologists have focused on the interaction between individuals and their environment in an effort to understand future impacts from habitat loss and climate change. Tools to examine this interaction have included: fractal analysis, first passage time, L{\'{e}}vy flights, multi-behavioral analysis, hidden markov models, and state-space models. Concurrent with the development of movement models has been an increase in the sophistication and availability of hierarchical bayesian models. In this review we bring these two threads together by using hierarchical structures as a framework for reviewing individual models. We synthesize emerging themes in movement ecology, and propose a new hierarchical model for animal movement that builds on these emerging themes. This model moves away from traditional random walks, and instead focuses inference on how moving animals with complex behavior interact with their landscape and make choices about its suitability.},

abstract = {Numerous methods are currently available to track animal movements. However, only one of these, dead-reckoning, has the capacity to provide continuous data for animal movements over fine scales. Dead-reckoning has been applied almost exclusively in the study of marine species, in part due to the difficulty of accurately measuring the speed of terrestrial species. In the present study we evaluate the use of accelerometers and a metric known as overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as a proxy for the measurement of speed for use in dead-reckoning. Data were collated from previous studies, for 10 species locomoting on a treadmill and their ODBA measured by an attached data logger. All species except one showed a highly significant linear relationship between speed and ODBA; however, there was appreciable inter- and intra-specific variance in this relationship. ODBA was then used to estimate speed in a simple trial run of a dead-reckoning track. Estimating distance travelled using speed derived from prior calibration for ODBA resulted in appreciable errors. We describe a method by which these errors can be minimised, by periodic ground-truthing (e.g., by GPS or VHF telemetry) of the dead-reckoned track and adjusting the relationship between speed and ODBA until actual known positions and dead-reckoned positions accord.},

Harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) have a large vocal repertoire and many of their underwater vocalizations consist of multiple elements. Between-call and within-call variability of element and interval durations for the thirteen multiple-element call types were very consistent. These elements are repeated regularly in predictable patterns. Three distinct patterns were identified with respect to the timing of call intervals: all intervals {\textless}1 s (short-short pattern), all intervals {\textgreater}1 s (long-long pattern) and intervals alternating between {\textless}1 s and {\textgreater}1 s (shortlong pattern). Harp seal multiple-element calls are rhythmically repeated and elements of the calls occur at highly predictable intervals. Rhythmical repetition would likely enhance the probability of a call being detected and could serve to identify the species of the caller.},

abstract = {Observations of marine fish and invertebrates on an inshore reef were made using TV and acoustic tags one week before, during, and four days after a seismic triple G. airgun (three synchronised airguns, each gun 2.5 l and 2000 psi) was deployed and repeatedly fired. The guns were fired once/min for eight periods on four days at different positions. The structure and intensity of the sound of each triple G. gun explosion was recorded and calibrated. Peak sound pressure levels of 210 dB (rel to 1 [mu]Pa) at 16 m range and 195 dB (rel to 1 [mu]Pa) at 109 m range were measured at positions where the fish were being observed. The final position of the triple G. gun, at 5.3 m range, had a peak pressure level of 218 dB (rel to 1 [mu]Pa). Neither the fish, nor the invertebrates, showed any signs of moving away from the reef. Firing the guns did not interrupt a diurnal rhythm of fish gathering at dusk and passing the TV camera position while the guns were firing. The long-term day-to-night movements of two tagged pollack were slightly changed by the arrival and banging of the guns particularly when positioned within 10 m of their normal living positions. Those reef fish, watched by the TV camera, always showed involuntary reactions in the form of a Mauthner cell reflex, C-start, at each explosion of the guns at all ranges tested (maximum range was 109 m, 195 dB rel to 1 [mu]Pa). When the explosion source was not visible to the fish, the C-start reaction was cut short and the fish continued with what they were doing before the stimulus. When the G. gun rack was sunk to the seabed (depth 14 m) visible to the fish and the TV camera, those fish that were observed approaching the G. gun rack when the guns were fired were seen to turn and flee from the very visible explosion. When the gun rack was suspended midwater (5 m depth) and just outside visible range at 16 metres, the fish receiving a 6 ms peak to peak, 206 dB (rel to 1 [mu]Pa) pressure swing exhibited a C-start and then continued to swim towards the gun position, their intended swimming track apparently unaltered. The sound of the G. guns had little effect on the day-to-day behaviour of the resident fish and invertebrates.},

abstract = {Sounds were produced by the topmouth minnow Pseudorasbora parva, a common Eurasian cyprinid, during feeding but not during intraspecific interactions. Feeding sounds were short broadband pulses with main energies between 100 and 800 Hz. They varied in their characteristics (number of single sounds per feeding sequence, sound duration and period, and sound pressure level) depending on the food type (chironomid larvae, Tubifex worms and flake food). The loudest sounds were emitted when food was taken up at the water surface, most probably reflecting 'suctorial' feeding. Auditory sensitivities were determined between 100 and 4000 Hz utilizing the auditory evoked potentials recording technique. Under laboratory conditions and in the presence of natural ambient noise recorded in Lake Neusiedl in eastern Austria, best hearing sensitivities were between 300 and 800 Hz (57 dB re 1 03BCPa v. 72 dB in the presence of ambient noise). Threshold-to-noise ratios were positively correlated to the sound frequency. The correlation between sound spectra and auditory thresholds revealed that P. parva can detect conspecific sounds up to 40 cm distance under ambient noise conditions. Thus, feeding sounds could serve as an auditory cue for the presence of food during foraging.},

abstract = {The target strength as a function of aspect angle were measured for four species of fish using dolphin-like and porpoise-like echolocation signals. The polar diagram of target strength values measured from an energy flux density perspective showed considerably less fluctuation with azimuth than would a pure tone pulse. Using detection range data obtained from dolphin and porpoise echolocation experiments, the detection ranges for the Atlantic cod by echolocating dolphins and porpoises were calculated for three aspect angles of the cod. Maximum detection ranges occurred when the fish was broadside to the odontocete and minimum detection ranges occurred when the cod was in the tail aspect. Maximum and minimum detection ranges for the bottlenose dolphin in a noise-limited environment was calculated to be 93 and 70 m, respectively. In a quiet environment, maximum and minimum detection ranges for the bottlenose dolphin were calculated to be 173 and 107 m, respectively. The detection ranges for the harbor porpoise in a quiet environment were calculated to be between 15 and 27 m. The primary reason for the large differences in detection ranges between both species was attributed to the 36 dB higher source level of the bottlenose dolphin echolocation signals.

abstract = {Attaching bio-telemetry or -logging devices ('tags') to marine animals for research and monitoring adds drag to streamlined bodies, affecting posture, swimming gaits and energy balance. These costs have never been measured in free-swimming cetaceans. To examine the effect of drag from a tag on metabolic rate, cost of transport, and swimming behavior, four captive male dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were trained to swim a set course, either non-instrumented (n = 7) or instrumented with a tag (DTAG2; n = 12), and surface exclusively in a flow-through respirometer where oxygen consumption (V̇O2) and carbon dioxide production (V̇CO2; mL kg(-1) min(-1)) rates were measured and respiratory exchange ratio (V̇O2/V̇CO2) was calculated. Tags did not significantly affect individual mass-specific oxygen consumption, Physical Activity Ratios (exercise V̇O2/resting V̇O2), total or net cost of transport (COT, J m(-1) kg(-1)) or locomotor costs during swimming or two-minute recovery phases. However, individuals swam significantly slower when tagged (by {\~{}}11{\%}; mean±s.d. 3.31±0.35 m s(-1)) compared to when non-instrumented (3.73±0.41 m s(-1)). A combined theoretical and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model estimating drag forces and power exertion during swimming suggests drag loading and energy consumption are reduced at lower swimming speeds. Bottlenose dolphins in the specific swimming task in this experiment slowed to the point where the tag yielded no increases in drag or power, while showing no difference in metabolic parameters when instrumented with a DTAG2. These results, and our observations, suggest that animals modify their behavior to maintain metabolic output and energy expenditure when faced with tag-induced drag.},

abstract = {Behavior of rockfish (Sebastes spp.) exposed to air-gun sounds was examined to establish parameters in a subsequent fishing experiment to determine the effects of a geophysical survey device on fishing success. Rockfish observed in a field enclosure showed startle and alarm responses during 10-min exposures to sounds from a single 1 639-cm3 air gun. For olive and black rockfish (S. serranoides and S. melanops), the threshold for the startle responses lay between 200 and 205 dB re 1-mu-Pa. Under sound presentation, blue rockfish (S. mystinus) milled in increasingly tighter mills, and schools of black rockfish collapsed to the bottom. Vermilion (S. miniatus) and olive rockfish formed stationary schools near the bottom and, on sound presentation, either rose in the water column or moved to the bottom and became almost motionless. The general threshold for the alarm responses was about 1 80 dB re 1-mu-Pa. Regression analyses of changes in depth distribution and shifts to active behaviors suggested that more subtle behavioral responses to sounds might become evident at 161 dB re 1-mu-Pa. These initial responses were sustained only for a few minutes and may differ from those of unconfined fish.},

abstract = {There is widespread concern over the presence of Hg in fish consumed by humans. While studies have been focused on determining the Hg concentration in sport fish and some commercial fish, little attention has been directed to canned tuna; it is widely held that concentrations are low. In the present study, the amount of Hg present in canned tuna purchased in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, was examined, and the brand, temporal variation, type, and packaging medium impacts on Hg concentrations in tuna were explored. A significant (p {\textless} 0.001) brand difference was noted: Brand 3 contained higher Hg concentrations ({\$}\backslashbar x{\$} standard deviation (SD) (0.777 +/- 0.320 ppm) than Brands 1 (0.541 +/- 0.114 ppm) and 2 (0.550 +/- 0.199 ppm). Chunk white tuna (0.619 +/- 0.212 ppm) and solid white tuna (0.576 +/- 0.178 ppm) were both significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) higher in mean Hg than chunk light tuna (0.137 +/- 0.063 ppm). No significant temporal variation was noted, and packaging had no significant effect on Hg concentration. In total, 55{\%} of all tuna examined was above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) safety level for human consumption (0.5 ppm), and 5{\%} of the tuna exceeded the action level established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) (1.0 ppm). These results indicate that stricter regulation of the canned tuna industry is necessary to ensure the safety of sensitive populations such as pregnant women, infants, and children. According to the U.S. EPA reference dose of 0.1 microg/kg body weight per day and a mean Hg value of 0.619 ppm, a 25-kg child may consume a meal (75 g) of canned chunk white tuna only once every 18.6 d. Continued monitoring of the industry and efforts to reduce Hg concentrations in canned tuna are recommended. Environ.},

Of 71 distinct sightings reported since 1936, 39 (54.9{\%}) were mother-calf pairs observed close to the shore. Most of these sightings (91.5{\%}) were reported from early July to late October. Eight confirmed strandings of this species were observed within the surveyed area, six of which were between July and October. Stranded calves represented 62.5{\%} of these records. Two calves showed evidence of incidental capture. The increasing number of sightings, and recent reports of stranded calves and one adult female could be indicative of an increase in cetacean research efforts in the region. However, it also suggests use of the southeastern Brazilian coast as an important right whale calving area.},

How is the stochastic evolution of molecular biological systems shaped by natural selection? Here, we derive a theorem on the fitness flux in a population, defined as the selective effect of its genotype frequency changes. The fitness-flux theorem generalizes Fisher{\^{a}}€™s fundamental theorem of natural selection to evolutionary processes including mutations, genetic drift, and time-dependent selection. It shows that a generic state of populations is adaptive evolution: there is a positive fitness flux resulting from a surplus of beneficial over deleterious changes. In particular, stationary nonequilibrium evolution processes are predicted to be adaptive. Under specific nonstationary conditions, notably during a decrease in population size, the average fitness flux can become negative. We show that these predictions are in accordance with experiments in bacteria and bacteriophages and with genomic data in Drosophila. Our analysis establishes fitness flux as a universal measure of adaptation in molecular evolution.},

Density was significantly higher on organic farms for six out of 16 species, and none on conventional. Total abundance of all species combined was higher on organic farms in both years. Analyses using an information-theoretic approach suggested that both habitat extent and farm type were important predictors only for starling and greenfinch. Organic farming as currently practised may not provide significant benefits to those bird species that are limited by winter food resources, in particular, several declining granivores.},

abstract = {The statocyst of octopods is a sack containing endolymph, lying in a larger cavity, containing perilymph and crossed by strands containing blood vessels. The arrangement shows remarkable parallels with vertebrates. The crista runs a course in three planes, each section being innervated by a separate nerve. It thus presumably serves as a receptor resolving angular accelerations. Each of the parts is further divided into three subsections, with its own flap of massed, loaded hairs. In front of the vertical crista is a rigid plate of cartilage, the anticrista, perhaps serving to prevent stimulation of that part of the ridge when the octopus suddenly accelerates during an attack. The crista contains large hair cells at its centre, there being alternately sections with one row and two rows of these. Flanking the large hair cells are inner and outer rows of smaller hair cells. These show characteristic differences and are asymmetrical above and below. All the hair cells are held to be neurosensory cells, carrying axons. In addition there are present multipolar cells, which besides carrying hairs also have many dendrites, making contact with other hair cells. Some of these multipolar cells probably lack hairs and thus form true peripheral neurons, stimulated by the overlying hair cells. The latter still, however, continue to be primary receptor cells with their own axons. If this is so there are two channels from these hair cells to the C.N.S. Each fires through its own axon and several together fire through each multipolar cell. A third set of nerve fibres is present in the crista, having cell bodies within the C.N.S. and endings around the apical parts of the hair cells and around the nerve cells. These are probably efferent fibres. The macula is placed vertically on the antero-medial wall, with a statolith hanging on it. It contains hair cells with short hairs embedded in the statolith. Multipolar cells lie below the hair cells and have axons but probably no hairs. There is a plexus of presumably efferent fibres. The membranous wall of the statocyst contains muscle fibres, a plexus of nerve fibres, and receptor cells with hairs and (sometimes) dendritic processes. These may be pressure receptors recording changes of pressure within the mantle and body cavity. The outer wall of the statocyst, though mainly cartilaginous, has a membranous region. This plexus and its receptors are especially well developed in a protruding posterior sack. Kolliker's canal lies in the wall of the statocyst and opens into its cavity, the other end being a closed tube. Its cells are ciliated. It may serve to regulate the endolymphatic pressure by secretion or absorption, assisted by the action of the muscle fibres and perhaps by the receptors of the wall of the sack.},

abstract = {The vocal repertoire, structure, and behavioral context of airborne vocalizations produced by Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) are described using recordings made at a breeding colony on Kanowna Island, Bass Strait, Australia. The study identified six different call types: three produced by males (bark, guttural threat, and submissive call); five produced by females (bark, guttural threat, submissive call, growl, and pup attraction call) and the female attraction call produced by pups and yearlings. Vocalizations were compared according to age and sex classes. The overall structure and function of the pup attraction and female attraction call produced by females, yearlings, and pups, was similar. However, while similar in their overall appearance, certain call types have a lower fundamental frequency when compared with other fur seals. In addition, the male bark call alters in rate of production according to the context used, where calls are slower when males are stationary and advertising their territorial status and faster when males are involved in confrontations with other males or actively herding females. Further research is required to investigate changes in environmental conditions and their effects on shaping the call structure and communication in Australian fur seals.},

abstract = {The behavioural response study (BRS) is an experimental design used by field biologists to determine the function and/or behavioural effects of conspecific, heterospecific or anthropogenic stimuli. When carrying out these studies in marine mammals it is difficult to make basic observations and achieve sufficient samples sizes because of the high cost and logistical difficulties. Rarely are other factors such as social context or the physical environment considered in the analysis because of these difficulties. This paper presents results of a BRS carried out in humpback whales to test the response of groups to one recording of conspecific social sounds and an artificially generated tone stimulus. Experiments were carried out in September/October 2004 and 2008 during the humpback whale southward migration along the east coast of Australia. In total, 13 'tone' experiments, 15 'social sound' experiments (using one recording of social sounds) and three silent controls were carried out over two field seasons. The results (using a mixed model statistical analysis) suggested that humpback whales responded differently to the two stimuli, measured by changes in course travelled and dive behaviour. Although the response to 'tones' was consistent, in that groups moved offshore and surfaced more often (suggesting an aversion to the stimulus), the response to 'social sounds' was highly variable and dependent upon the composition of the social group. The change in course and dive behaviour in response to 'tones' was found to be related to proximity to the source, the received signal level and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This study demonstrates that the behavioural responses of marine mammals to acoustic stimuli are complex. In order to tease out such multifaceted interactions, the number of replicates and factors measured must be sufficient for multivariate analysis.},

abstract = {Two female loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) were tracked, following nesting at Alagadi Beach (35°33'N, 33°47'E), Northern Cyprus, eastern Mediterranean for 60 and 82 days, respectively. The two individuals showed marked differences in their behaviour. Individual A was tracked to Syrian coastal waters, whereas individual B travelled around the coast of Northern Cyprus to a foraging site in the waters off the east coast of Northern Cyprus. Submergence durations varied markedly during different phases of the migration, suggesting coastal foraging/resting at certain stages en route with sustained directed travelling movements during initial coastal movements and open ocean crossing. Both turtles showed fidelity to foraging grounds for the duration of transmissions (Turtle A: 36 days; Turtle B: 58 days). In both cases, locations were centred in inshore waters although the two individuals exhibited quite different submergence patterns. Individual A carried out very short dives of typical duration {\textless}10 min, whereas Individual B carried out longer dives with typical duration {\textgreater}20 min. Diel differences in submergence duration at the foraging grounds suggested longer dives at night/early morning for both turtles. For Turtle A, there was a general reduction in submergence duration as the period of residence increased; a pattern that may have been related to increasing temperature experienced. The total distance travelled by the two turtles (320 and 227 km) was relatively short when compared to satellite tracking studies of conspecifics following nesting in South Africa and USA and tagging studies of nesting loggerhead turtles in Greece and Australia. It is hypothesized that short migratory distance may be correlated with both the small body size and the relatively high frequency of remigration in this population.},

abstract = {Studies on the costs of sexual reproduction have focused primarily on the costs of heterosexual courtship and mating, whereas the costs of homosexual interactions, such as male-male or female-female displays and mounting, have been relatively neglected. This may reflect an implicit assumption that heterosexual interactions are more costly in most species, but this assumption has never been verified. We tested this assumption experimentally by comparing the effects of hetero- and homosexual interactions on life span in two distantly related insects with contrasting mating systems: the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, and the sexually dimorphic carrion fly Prochyliza xanthostoma. Despite pronounced behavioural and morphological differences between these species, results were remarkably congruent. Relative to individually housed virgin controls, male life span was reduced to a similar degree in males maintained with other males and males maintained with females. In contrast, female life span was strongly reduced relative to controls when females were kept with males, but was affected very little when females were maintained with other females. Thus, the costs of homosexual and heterosexual interactions are similar for males, but highly dissimilar for females. Our results suggest that the costs of homosexual interactions can be considerable, and may have important consequences for the evolution of mating systems.},

Using recent satellite-derived current estimates and leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) tracking data, we demonstrate that oceanic currents, usually neglected when analysing tracking data, can substantially distort the observed trajectories. Consequently, this will affect several important results deduced from the analysis of tracking data, such as the evaluation of the orientation skills and the energy budget of animals or the identification of foraging areas. We conclude that currents should be systematically taken into account to ensure the unbiased interpretation of tracking data, which now play a major role in marine conservation biology.},

abstract = {Neighbouring song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, in our Seattle population share song types and sometimes respond to neighbour song by type matching (replying with the same song type being sung) or repertoire matching (replying with a shared song other than the type being sung). Based on our modification of the threat hypothesis of Krebs et al. (1981,Animal Behaviour , 29, 918-923), according to which, type matching is a threat, we develop two predictions concerning type matching. (1) A bird will be more likely to escalate when type matched by his neighbour than when repertoire matched. (2) When type matched, birds who escalate will continue to sing the matched song type, while those who de-escalate will switch off the matched type or stop singing. To test these predictions we conducted an interactive playback experiment that simulated a bird in an adjoining territory issuing a song reply to a singing subject. We exposed subjects to three song playback conditions, each on a different day: a type match, a repertoire match and an unshared stranger song (to provide an estimate of each subjects maximum response for comparison with their responses to type matching). Subjects responded consistently and most aggressively to stranger song. Subjects responded more aggressively to type-matching playback than to repertoire-matching playback, supporting our first prediction. In type-matching trials, subjects did not always respond aggressively, and those who stayed on the same song type throughout the trial responded more aggressively than those who switched to a different song, supporting the second prediction.},

abstract = {Declining net primary production (NPP) with forest age is often attributed to a corresponding decline in gross primary production (GPP). We tested two hypotheses explaining the decline of GPP in ageing stands (14-115 years old) of Pinus taeda L.: (1) increasing N limitation limits photosynthetic capacity and thus decreases GPP with increasing age; and (2) hydraulic limitations increasingly induce stomatal closure, reducing GPP with increasing age. We tested these hypotheses using measurements of foliar nitrogen, photosynthesis, sap-flow and dendroclimatological techniques. Hypothesis (1) was not supported; foliar N retranslocation did not increase and declines were not observed in foliar N, leaf area per tree or photosynthetic capacity. Hypothesis (2) was supported; declines were observed in light-saturated photosynthesis, leaf- and canopy-level stomatal conductance, concentration of CO(2) inside leaf air-spaces (corroborated by an increase in wood $\delta$(13) C) and specific leaf area (SLA), while stomatal limitation and the ratio of sapwood area (SA) to leaf area increased. The sensitivity of radial growth to inter-annual variation in temperature and drought decreased with age, suggesting that tree water use becomes increasingly conservative with age. We conclude that hydraulic limitation increasingly limits the photosynthetic rates of ageing loblolly pine trees, possibly explaining the observed reduction of NPP.},

abstract = {The first evidence suggestive of in vivo gas bubble formation in cetacea, including eight animals stranded in the UK, has recently been reported. This article presents the pathologic findings from these eight UK-stranded cetaceans and two additional UK-stranded cetacean cases in detail. Hepatic gas-filled cavitary lesions (0.2-6.0 cm diameter) involving approximately 5-90{\%} of the liver volume were found in four (two juvenile, two adult) Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), three (two adult, one juvenile) common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), an adult Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris), and an adult harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Histopathologic examination of the seven dolphin cases with gross liver cavities revealed variable degrees of pericavitary fibrosis, microscopic, intrahepatic, spherical, nonstaining cavities (typically 50-750 {\{}micro{\}}m in diameter) consistent with gas emboli within distended portal vessels and sinusoids and associated with hepatic tissue compression, hemorrhages, fibrin/organizing thrombi, and foci of acute hepato-cellular necrosis. Two common dolphins also had multiple and bilateral gross renal cavities (2.0-9.0 mm diameter) that, microscopically, were consistent with acute (n = 2) and chronic (n = 1) arterial gas emboli-induced renal infarcts. Microscopic, bubblelike cavities were also found in mesenteric lymph node (n = 4), adrenal (n = 2), spleen (n = 2), pulmonary associated lymph node (n = 1), posterior cervical lymph node (n = 1), and thyroid (n = 1). No bacterial organisms were isolated from five of six cavitated livers and one of one cavitated kidneys. The etiology and pathogenesis of these lesions are not known, although a decompression-related mechanism involving embolism of intestinal gas or de novo gas bubble (emboli) development derived from tissues supersaturated with nitrogen is suspected.},

However, information on the songs and population structure of fin whales in the North Pacific is limited. We analyzed fin whale songs recorded over 9 months by an Autonomous Underwater Recorder for Acoustic Listening device (AURAL, Multi-Electronique Inc.) deployed west of Vancouver Island, British Columbia (July 2010 to March 2011). Our analysis focused on internote intervals—the song characteristic that others have shown to display the most geographic variation. We found that beginning in mid-August and continuing to the end of our study, fin whales produced one stereotyped song consisting of alternating classic (C) and backbeat (B) notes. Internote interval evolved slightly over this time period, and small differences in interval length occurred among individual songs. However, all songs shared the same note arrangement (i.e., the interval between C and B notes was always 30{\%} longer than the interval between B and C notes). All whales recorded in this study produced a similar song, suggesting that they may belong to the same acoustic population. Future studies will help to determine the spatio-temporal boundaries of this acoustic population.},

The functions of vocal matching are less well understood in fission/fusion species that are non-territorial, live in groups with variable composition, and lack multiple alarm signals. Here we present the results of interactive playbacks in a fission/fusion parrot species, the orange-fronted conjure (Aratinga canicularis), that provide evidence of vocal matching. A randomly selected loud contact call (chee) per trial was played to passing wild flocks and short-term captives in Costa Rica. Of the trials where subjects interacted, 30{\%} of wild flocks and 21{\%} of captive trials showed significantly linear or curvilinear changes in similarity between the stimulus and response chees over the course of the trial. Surprisingly, both convergent and divergent sequences were observed, and many trials lacking a single trend showed disjunct changes in stimulus-response similarity. These results suggest that chee exchanges prior to flock fusions are not simply an exchange of greetings but are more likely some form of negotiation. This would explain the presence of convergent, divergent, and variable patterns of stimulus-response similarity seen in our experiments.},

abstract = {Groups of spinner dolphins have been shown to cooperatively herd small prey. It was hypothesized that the strong group coordination is maintained by acoustic communication, specifically by frequency-modulated whistles. Observations of groups of spinner dolphins foraging at night within a sound-scattering layer were made with a multibeam echosounder while the rates of dolphin sounds were measured using four hydrophones at 6 m depth intervals. Whistles were only detected when dolphins were not foraging and when animals were surfacing. Differences in click rates were found between depths and between different foraging stages but were relatively low when observations indicated that dolphins were actively feeding despite the consistency of these clicks with echolocation signals. Highest click rates occurred within the scattering layer, during transitions between foraging states. This suggests that clicks may be used directly or indirectly to cue group movement during foraging, potentially by detecting other individuals' positions in the group or serving a direct communicative role which would be contrary to the existing assumption that echolocation and communication are compartmentalized. Communicating via clicks would be beneficial as the signal's characteristics minimize the chance of eavesdropping by competing dolphins and large fish. Our results are unable to support the established paradigm for dolphin acoustic communication and suggest an alternate coordination mechanism in foraging spinner dolphins.},

This study investigates relative abundance, behavior, and movement patterns of gray whales in relation to occurrence and proximity to the seismic survey by employing scan sampling, focal follow, and theodolite tracking methodologies. These data were analyzed in relation to temporal, environmental, and seismic related variables to evaluate potential disturbance reactions of gray whales to the seismic survey. The relative numbers of whales and pods recorded from five shore-based stations were not significantly different during periods when seismic surveys were occurring compared to periods when no seismic surveys were occurring and to the post-seismic period. Univariate analyses indicated no significant statistical correlation between seismic survey variables and any of the eleven movement and behavior variables. Multiple regression analyses indicated that, after accounting for temporal and environmental variables, 6 of 11 movement and behavior variables (linearity, acceleration, mean direction, blows per surfacing, and surface-dive blow rate) were not significantly associated with seismic survey variables, and 5 of 11 variables (leg speed, reorientation rate, distance-from-shore, blow interval, and dive time) were significantly associated with seismic survey variables. In summary, after accounting for environmental variables, no correlation was found between seismic survey variables and the linearity of whale movements, changes in whale swimming speed between theodolite fixes, mean direction of whale movement, mean number of whale exhalations per minute at the surface, mean time at the surface, and mean number of exhalations per minute during a whales surface-to-dive cycle. In contrast, at higher received sound energy exposure levels, whales traveled faster, changed directions of movement less, were recorded further from shore, and stayed under water longer between respirations.},

abstract = {In sperm whales (Physeter catodon L. 1758) the nose is vastly hypertrophied, accounting for about one-third of the length or weight of an adult male. Norris and Harvey [in Animal Orientation and Navigation, NASA SP-262 (1972), pp. 397-417] ascribed a sound-generating function to this organ complex. A sound generator weighing upward of 10 tons and with a cross-section of 1 m is expected to generate high-intensity, directional sounds. This prediction from the Norris and Harvey theory is not supported by published data for sperm whale clicks (source levels of 180 dB re 1 mu Pa and little, if any, directionality). Either the theory is not borne out or the data is not representative for the capabilities of the sound-generating mechanism. To increase the amount of relevant data, a five-hydrophone array, suspended from three platforms separated by 1 km and linked by radio, was deployed at the slope of the continental shelf off Andenes, Norway, in the summers of 1997 and 1998. With this system, source levels up to 223 dB re 1 mu Pa peRMS were recorded. Also, source level differences of 35 dB for the same click at different directions were seen, which are interpreted as evidence for high directionality. This implicates sonar as a possible function of the clicks. Thus, previously published properties of sperm whale clicks underestimate the capabilities of the sound generator and therefore cannot falsify the Norris and Harvey theory.

In the laboratory it has been shown that various appeasement patterns must be performed by an intruder shrimp towards a crab before the shrimp is accepted on the coral by the crab. These patterns appear to be borrowed from the crab's appeasement repertoire and are never performed between shrimps among themselves. The shrimp, as the weaker of the two, has to "learn" how to inhibit the stronger crab's aggression by using the crab's own language.},

abstract = {The function and structure of alarm signals may vary with the caller's age, and some of this variation may be because young may have to attract the attention of their caregivers. The structure of calls may reveal this function. Yellow-bellied marmot, Marmota flaviventris, pups utter a novel vocalization, an elongated scream, which often contains nonlinear acoustic characteristics, 6{\%} of the time when handled within about a week of emergence from their natal burrow. With a single exception in over 4000 captures, only pups uttered these unique vocalizations. Acoustically, pup screams are more than an order of magnitude longer than pup alarm calls and a majority of the screams have at least one type of nonlinearity. Playback experiments showed that average-length screams elicited higher-level responses than adult alarm calls and that elongated and average-length screams elicited higher-level responses than shortened screams. The acoustic structure of screams makes them especially evocative, and they may function to allow pups to recruit their mothers to help them fend off predators. More generally, an examination of nonlinearities in vocalizations of other species suggests that nonlinearities may be an honest indicator of arousal, and this honesty elicits heightened responses in receivers.

abstract = {Sound communication plays a vital role in frog reproduction, in which vocal advertisement is generally the domain of males. Females are typically silent, but in a few anuran species they can produce a feeble reciprocal call or rapping sounds during courtship. Males of concave-eared torrent frogs (Odorrana tormota) have demonstrated ultrasonic communication capacity. Although females of O. tormota have an unusually well-developed vocal production system, it is unclear whether or not they produce calls or are only passive partners in a communication system dominated by males. Here we show that before ovulation, gravid females of O. tormota emit calls that are distinct from males' advertisement calls, having higher fundamental frequencies and harmonics and shorter call duration. In the field and in a quiet, darkened indoor arena, these female calls evoke vocalizations and extraordinarily precise positive phonotaxis (a localization error of {\textless}1 degrees ), rivalling that of vertebrates with the highest localization acuity (barn owls, dolphins, elephants and humans). The localization accuracy of O. tormota is remarkable in light of their small head size (interaural distance of {\textless}1 cm), and suggests an additional selective advantage of high-frequency hearing beyond the ability to avoid masking by low-frequency background noise.},

abstract = {The performance of large-aperture hydrophone arrays to detect and localize blue and fin whales' 15-85 Hz signature vocalizations under ocean noise conditions was assessed through simulations from a normal mode propagation model combined to noise statistics from 15 960 h of recordings in Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park. The probability density functions of 2482 summer noise level estimates in the call bands were used to attach a probability of detection/masking to the simulated call levels as a function of whale depth and range for typical environmental conditions. Results indicate that call detection was modulated by the calling depth relative to the sound channel axis and by modal constructive and destructive interferences with range. Masking of loud infrasounds could reach 40{\%} at 30 km for a receiver at the optimal depth. The 30 dB weaker blue whale D-call were subject to severe masking. Mapping the percentages of detection and localization allowed assessing the performance of a six-hydrophone array under mean- and low-noise conditions. This approach is helpful for optimizing hydrophone configuration in implementing passive acoustic monitoring arrays and building their detection function for whale density assessment, as an alternative to or in combination with the traditional undersampling visual methods.},

The birds matched their own songs most often and those of strangers least. We had predicted that strangers would be matched most, because previous work had shown an association between matching and a strong response. An analysis using a difference index showed that the birds matched most often when the stimulus song was very similar in detailed structure to their own rendition of the song. This was confirmed in a second experiment in which we played [`]similar' and [`]different' renditions recorded from strangers. However, once the effect of similarity was partialled out there was a residual tendency to match strangers more than neighbours, as we had first predicted. We discuss the implications of these results for perception of song categories by the birds, possible use by the birds of their own songs as [`]standards' and the functional significance of matching.},

abstract = {Studies have shown that pelagic predators do not overlap with their prey at small scales. However, we hypothesized that spinner dolphin foraging would be affected by the spatio-temporal dynamics of their prey at both small and large scales. A modified echosounder was used to simultaneously measure the abundance of dolphins and their prey as a function of space and time off three Hawaiian islands. Spinner dolphin abundance closely matched the abundance patterns in the boundary community both horizontally and vertically. As hypothesized, spinner dolphins followed the diel horizontal migration of their prey, rather than feeding offshore the entire night. Spinner dolphins also followed the vertical migrations of their prey and exploited the vertical areas within the boundary layer that had the highest prey density. Cooperative foraging by pairs of dolphins within large groups was evident. The geometric and density characteristics of prey patches containing dolphins indicate that dolphins may alter the characteristics of prey patches through this cooperative foraging. The overlap of Hawaiian spinner dolphins and their prey at many temporal and spatial scales, ranging from several minutes to an entire night and 20 m to several kilometers, indicates that the availability of truly synoptic data may fundamentally alter our conclusions about pelagic predator-prey interactions.},

Chirp-squeaks, barks, trills, and sounds transitional between chirp-squeaks and barks and trills (prebarks and pretrills) are defined. Chirp-squeaks are frequency-modulated signals in the 3 to 18-kHz range lasting ca. 60 ms. Trills last as long as 2,200 ms, are frequency-modulated over a bandwidth of 740 Hz within the 3-18-kHz band, and have two to four or more harmonics. Barks are broadband signals of 500 to 2,200 Hz lasting 30-120 ms with up to five harmonics. Dugongs may produce all of these sounds in the frontal region of the head rather than in the larynx. Chirp-squeaks, recorded from at least nine individuals, were emitted as dugongs rooted in the bottom or patrolled mutually exclusive activity zones, but not when dugongs were stationary or were investigating the research vessel. Frequency and amplitude modulation of chirp-squeaks suggests a ranging function. Variability among individuals in chirp-squeak characteristics may be adequate for a signature function. Barks have physical characteristics appropriate for aggressive behavior. They were recorded in circumstances suggesting territorial defense. Trills had characteristics more appropriate to affiliative functions and were associated with movements that appeared to be displays.},

abstract = {Eavesdropping involves the extraction of information from signalling interactions by individuals not directly involved. Such behaviour has been conclusively demonstrated by experiments that present songbirds with simulated singing interactions in which the roles of interactants were varied by changing the timing of songs. We examined the phenomenon of song type matching by presenting male great tits, Parus major, with simulated interactions in which one interactant switched song type such that it matched (or not) that sung by the opponent. Subjects responded to simulated intrusion by previously heard interactants by singing significantly shorter songs in response to males that switched (i.e. used two song types), regardless of whether or not matching occurred, compared with those that used one. Subjects also showed a significantly lower level of approach behaviour to males whose opponents had switched song types but not matched. Male great tits are therefore capable of extracting different kinds of information by eavesdropping on interactions between others and using that information when deciding how to respond to subsequent intrusion. These results confirm and expand our knowledge on the potential of eavesdropping to provide accurate information on the likely strengths and weaknesses of potential rivals.},

Using a dual high-speed video camera system, spatiotemporal observations of echolocation characteristics were conducted on bats during a landing flight task in the laboratory. The Telemike allowed us to observe emitted pulses and returning echoes to which the flying bats listened during flight, and the acoustic parameters could be precisely measured without traditional problems such as the directional properties of the recording microphone and the emitted pulse, or traveling loss of the sound in the air. Pulse intensity in bats intending to land exhibited a marked decrease by 30 dB; within 2 m of the target Wall, and the reduction rate was approximately 6.5 dB per halving of distance. The intensity of echoes returning from the target wall indicated a nearly constant intensity (-42.6 +/- 5.5 dB weaker than the pulse emitted in search phase) within a target distance of 2 m. These findings provide direct evidence that bats adjust pulse intensity to compensate for changes in echo intensity to maintain a constant intensity of the echo returned from the approaching target at an optimal range.

abstract = {A previous study has reported that Atlantic cod can be conditioned to detect ultrasonic sound pulses of high intensity. This capability has been proposed as a mean for detection and avoidance of echolocating toothed whales that emit intense ultrasonic clicks. In this study, we use acoustic playbacks to test the hypotheses that unconditioned cod can detect and respond to intense ultrasound from toothed whales and from echosounders. Intense ultrasound exposure of 210 dB re. 1muPa (pp) did not cause a short-term stress response in the form of bradycardia in unconditioned cod. Free-swimming cod exposed to ultrasonic clicks and echosounder pulses with received levels of more than 204 dB re. 1 muPa (pp) did not elicit flight responses as seen in ultrasound detecting Alosinae. Furthermore, we tested the debilitating effects of high intensity ultrasound on swimming cod with no detected changes in swimming ability when exposed to more than 213 dB re. 1 muPa (pp). It is concluded that intense ultrasound exposure induces neither an antipredator nor a stress response in Atlantic cod, and that echosounder pulses and biosonar clicks therefore most probably play no ecophysiological role in wild cod populations.},

abstract = {The assessment report of the 4th International Panel on Climate Change confirms that global warming is strongly affecting biological systems and that 20{\^{a}}€“30{\%} of species risk extinction from projected future increases in temperature. It is essential that any measures taken to conserve individual species and their constituent populations against climate-mediated declines are appropriate. The release of captive bred animals to augment wild populations is a widespread management strategy for many species but has proven controversial. Using a regression model based on a 37-year study of wild and sea ranched Atlantic salmon () spawning together in the wild, we show that the escape of captive bred animals into the wild can substantially depress recruitment and more specifically disrupt the capacity of natural populations to adapt to higher winter water temperatures associated with climate variability. We speculate the mechanisms underlying this seasonal response and suggest that an explanation based on bio-energetic processes with physiological responses synchronized by photoperiod is plausible. Furthermore, we predict, by running the model forward using projected future climate scenarios, that these cultured fish substantially increase the risk of extinction for the studied population within 20 generations. In contrast, we show that positive outcomes to climate change are possible if captive bred animals are prevented from breeding in the wild. Rather than imposing an additional genetic load on wild populations by releasing maladapted captive bred animals, we propose that conservation efforts should focus on optimizing conditions for adaptation to occur by reducing exploitation and protecting critical habitats. Our findings are likely to hold true for most poikilothermic species where captive breeding programmes are used in population management.},

abstract = {The snappping shrimp Alpheus heterochaelis produces a variety of different water currents during intraspecific encounters and interspecific interactions with small sympatric crabs (Eurypanopeus depressus). We studied the mechanisms of current production in tethered shrimp and the use of the different currents in freely behaving animals. The beating of the pleopods results in strong posteriorly directed currents. Although they reach rather far, these currents show no distinctions when directed toward different opponents. Gill currents are produced by movements of the scaphognathites (the exopodites of the second maxillae) and can then be deflected laterally by movements of the exopodites of the first and second maxillipeds. These frequent but slow lateral gill currents are most probably used to enhance chemical odor perception. The fast and focused, anteriorly directed gill currents, however, represent a powerful tool in intraspecific signaling, because they reach the chemo- and mechanosensory antennules of the opponent more often than any other currents and also because they are produced soon after previous contacts between the animals. They may carry chemical information about the social status of their producers since dominant shrimp release more anterior gill currents and more water jets than subordinate animals in intrasexual interactions.},

abstract = {Recordings of the acoustic activity of free-swimming groups of echolocating dolphins increase the likelihood of collecting overlapping click trains, originating from multiple individuals, in the same set of data. In order to evaluate the click properties of each individual based on such recordings it is necessary to identify which clicks originate from which animal. This paper suggests a computationally efficient strategy to separate overlapping click trains originating from multiple free-swimming bottlenose dolphins, enabling echolocation analysis at an individual level on several animals. This technique is based on sequential matching of the frequency spectra of successive clicks. The clicks are grouped together as individual click trains if the correlation coefficients between clicks are higher than a pre-set threshold level. The robustness of the algorithm is tested by adding artificially generated white Gaussian noise and comparing the results with other comparable commonly used methods based on inter-click intervals, centroid frequencies, and amplitude levels. The described method is applicable to a variety of experimental and observational contexts, e.g., those regarding echolocation development of calves, the hypothesized acoustic "etiquette" among dolphins when investigating the same object, and the possible occurrence of eavesdropping in large dolphin pods.},

abstract = {Bycatches are considered the most serious threat to harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and other small cetaceans worldwide. Pingers are used to reduce bycatch levels, but may also deter porpoises from critical habitats. We investigated the spatial and temporal responses of porpoises to simulated bottom-set nets equipped with periodically operating Dukane NetMark 1000 pingers. Echolocation rates were monitored by porpoise click train detectors (PODs) placed at and around the nets, and a shore-based observation team recorded surfacing positions and movements. Pinger sound significantly reduced the median echolocation encounter rate by 50{\%}{\&}ndash;100{\%} at PODs placed up to 500{\^{A}} m and reduced the sighting rate up to 375{\^{A}} m from the simulated net. The average distance of approach increased by 300{\^{A}} m. When pingers were silent after being active for 24{\^{A}} h 50{\^{A}} min, the return time of porpoises was 6{\^{A}} h, in comparison with 2.5{\^{A}} h after pingers had been silent. During the study period of approximately 50{\^{A}} days, habituation was detectable at two of nine PODs. The results indicate that pingers affect porpoises at greater distances than previously observed. This confirms that pingers are an effective bycatch mitigation measure, but alternative solutions should be applied in ecologically important habitats and migration routes. An example is given from the Baltic region.},

abstract = {The discovery of ultrasonic bat echolocation prompted a wide search for other animal biosonar systems, which yielded, among few others, two avian groups. One, the South American Oilbird (Steatornis caripensis: Caprimulgiformes), is nocturnal and eats fruit. The other is a selection of diurnal, insect-eating swiftlets (species in the genera Aerodramus and Collocalia: Apodidae) from across the Indo-Pacific. Bird echolocation is restricted to lower frequencies audible to humans, implying a system of poorer resolution than the ultrasonic ({\textgreater}20 kHz) biosonar of most bats and toothed whales. As such, bird echolocation has been labeled crude or rudimentary. Yet, echolocation is found in at least 16 extant bird species and has evolved several times in avian lineages. Birds use their syringes to produce broadband click-type biosonar signals that allow them to nest in dark caves and tunnels, probably with less predation pressure. There are ongoing discrepancies about several details of bird echolocation, from signal design to the question about whether echolocation is used during foraging. It remains to be seen if bird echolocation is as sophisticated as that of tongue-clicking rousette bats. Bird echolocation performance appears to be superior to that of blind humans using signals of notable similarity. However, no apparent specializations have been found so far in the birds' auditory system (from middle ear to higher processing centers). The advent of light-weight recording equipment and custom software for examining signals and reconstructing flight paths now provides the potential to study the echolocation behavior of birds in more detail and resolve such issues.},

abstract = {1. In terrestrially breeding phocid seals males are significantly larger than females with their large size conferring advantage in male-male competition, and increasing their ability to fast during the breeding season, prolonging tenure and hence mating opportunities. 2. For aquatically breeding seals, the opportunity to feed during the breeding season may offset the need for large size and the ability to fast. 3. Individual differences in male breeding success, behaviour and mass changes for Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) at Turtle Rock, McMurdo Sound (77.727S, 166.85E) during 1997, 1998 and 1999 were recorded. 4. Males were tracked under the ice through each breeding season using an acoustic array (n = 15). Mass changes were measured for 30 males, all of which were successfully genotyped and were aged between 6 and 20 years (mean 13.7). 5. Territory use was dynamic, with some males spending most of the time either at or near the surface, others diving deep and others switching from regular diving to near surface behaviour. 6. Rate of mass loss varied more than three-fold (mean 2.1 +/- 0.53 kg day(-1) range 0.0 to 4. 1) as did mass-specific loss (mean 0.53 +/- 0.23). 7. Maximum dive depth for the individuals also varied dramatically (10 to 518m) and was inversely related to the rate of mass-specific loss, suggesting that the deep diving males may offset the costs of breeding by foraging. 8. Males that stayed near the surface successfully sired pups as did males that continued to dive. Both strategies therefore seemed to be equally successful. 9. Foraging during the breeding season may be a male strategy that may potentially prolong tenure, but appears to be facultative rather than obligative. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

This paper examined a catalog of northern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus) photographs from the Gully, Nova Scotia, to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. This information can be used to select appropriate individuals and photographs to include in analyses. Individual northern bottlenose whales were sufficiently marked to uniquely identify individuals ({\&}xmacr;= 14.5 marks/individual; range 1-67), but not all mark types persisted over time. Reliable marks were defined as mark types that were not lost over the nine-yeat study period (notches, back indentation, and mottled patches). Individuals were considered reliably marked if they possessed at least one back indentation or mottled patch (located within one dorsal fin width, at the base of the dorsal fin) or a notch on the dorsal fin. Sixty-six percent (SE = 5{\%}) of the population were reliably marked. Longterm analyses (months to years) should use only reliably marked individuals, and the results scaled to account for the rest of the population. Our results also showed that photographic quality affected an observer's ability to identify individuals. For this catalog, quantitative analysis indicated only photographs of Q 2265 4 (on a 6-point scale with 6 representing the highest quality) should be included in mark-recapture analyses sensitive to heterogeneity.},

abstract = {The analysis of animal movement and resource use has become a standard tool in the study of animal ecology. Telemetry devices have become quite sophisticated in terms of overall size and data collecting capacity. Statistical methods to analyze movement have responded, becoming ever more complex, often relying on state-space modeling. Estimation of movement metrics such as utilization distributions have not followed suit, relying primarily on kernel density estimation. Here we consider a method for making inference about space use that is free of all of the major problems associated with kernel density estimation of utilization distributions such as autocorrelation, irregular time gaps, and error in observed locations. Our proposed method is based on a data augmentation approach that defines use as a summary of the complete path of the animal which is only partially observed. We use a sample from the posterior distribution of the complete path to construct a posterior sample for the metric of interest. Three basic importance sampling based methods for sampling from the posterior distribution of the path are proposed and compared. We demonstrate the augmentation approach by estimating a spatial map of diving intensity for female northern fur seals in the Pribilof Islands, Alaska.},

Vessel-induced avoidance can potentially cause a large bias in acoustic estimates of schooling, pelagic-fish biomass. This paper presents a method for quantifying this uncertainty. Volume-backscattering strength (Sv) from a horizontally projecting, multibeam sonar (Simrad MS70) is resampled to form synthetic, vertical, echosounder beams to the side of the survey vessel. These data are analysed as if they were collected from phantom vessels surveying parallel transects at fixed ranges from the real vessel. The nautical-area-backscattering coefficients (sA) from the synthetic echograms are compared with those measured by conventional 70 and 120 kHz echosounders (Simrad EK60) on the real vessel. Data collected in 2006 from schools of Norwegian spring-spawning herring are used to illustrate the method and explore its limitations. Potential effects of vessel-induced avoidance are evaluated by comparing the mean sA values observed from the phantom vessels with those observed from the real vessel. The technique also allows direct estimates of the mean lateral-aspect target strength of in situ herring.},

abstract = {Studies concerning the echolocation behaviour of odontocetes focus mainly on target detection and discrimination, either in stationary animals or in animals approaching a specific target. We present the first data on the use of echolocation for spatial orientation or navigation. Synchronised video and high-frequency recordings were made of two harbour porpoises trained to swim from one position to another across an outdoor pool in order to correlate swimming and echolocation behaviour. Both porpoises showed a clear range-locking behaviour on specific positions near the end of the pool, as indicated by a decrease in click interval with decreasing distance. The decrease in click interval followed the two-way-transit time, which is the time interval between the outgoing click and the received echo from the focal object. This suggests that the porpoises used focal objects as landmarks. The lag time, defined as the time between the arrival of an echo from a landmark and the emission of the next click, was task specific. The lag time was longer for difficult tasks (26-36 ms) and shorter for simpler tasks (14-19 ms), with some individual differences between the two animals. Our results suggest that echolocation by odontocetes is used not only for target detection, localisation and classification but also for spatial orientation.},

abstract = {Rhododendron ponticum has become a well-established invasive species throughout the British Isles and is now considered a problematic invasive weed species. The habitat requirements for establishment, however, have only previously been described qualitatively. The aim of this study was to quantify the influence of topographical and environmental characteristics on the probability of establishment of this invasive shrub in a woodland environment. A binomial generalized linear model (GLM), incorporating spatial autocorrelation, was used to model the presence/absence of R. ponticum seedlings ({\textless}7-year-old plants) given substrate type an, I depth, canopy type and percent cover, altitude, slope, aspect and the distance to the nearest seed source as covariates. Depth and type of substrate along with distance from the closest seed source were found to be the most important predictors of seedling,establishment. Specifically, fallen logs or tree stumps, newly colonised by moss, were identified as the most favourable habitat type for R. ponticum invasion. We show that the inclusion of spatial autocorrelation can affect model conclusions and, as a consequence, may influence management recommendations. Knowing how to reduce establishment can assist in managing invasive populations. Similarly, understanding how establishment probabilities vary according to habitat may aid the conservation of threatened populations. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The physical habitat of cetaceans occurring along the continental slope in the western Ligurian Sea was investigated. Data were collected from two different sighting platforms, one of the two being a whale-watching boat. Surveys, conducted from May to October and from 1996 to 2000, covered an area of approximately 3000 km(2) with a mean effort of about 10,000 km year(-1). A total of 814 sightings was reported, including all the species occurring in the area: Stenella coeruleoalba, Balaenoptera physalus, Physeter macrocephalus, Globicephala melas, Grampus griseus, Ziphius cavirostris, Tursiops truncatus, Delphinus delphis. A Geographic Information System was used to integrate sighting data to a set of environmental characteristics, which included bottom gradient, area between different isobaths, and length and linearity of the isobaths within a cell unit. Habitat use was analysed by means of a multi-dimensional scaling, MDS, analysis. Significant differences were found in the habitat preference of most of the species regularly occurring in the area. Bottlenose dolphin, Risso's dolphin, sperm whale and Cuvier's beaked whale were found strongly associated to well-defined depth and slope gradient characteristics of the shelf-edge and the upper and lower slope. The hypothesis of habitat segregation was considered for Risso's dolphin, sperm whale and Cuvier's beaked whale. Canonical discriminant functions using depth and slope as predictors outlined clear and not overlapping habitat preferences for Risso's dolphin and Cuvier's beaked whale, whereas a partial overlapping of the habitat of the other two species was observed for sperm whale. Such a partitioning of the upper and lower slope area may be the result of the common feeding habits and suggests a possible competition of these three species. A temporal segregation in the use of the slope area was also observed for sperm whales and Risso's dolphins. Fin whales, and the occasionally encountered common dolphin and long-finned pilot whales showed a generic preference for the pelagic area. In contrast, striped dolphins were generically found in any type of physical habitat, in agreement with their known opportunistic feeding habits. Interannual and seasonal movements were observed in fin whales and in all the other regularly occurring species, indicating that changes in the environmental and climatological conditions have a remarkable influence on habitat use. Finally, a relationship between group size and habitat use was observed for the species known to forage in groups. This relationship suggests that these species respond to environmental variability either by moving within the study area or by behavioural changes that may reflect changes in the preference for prey items.

Discrete-time hidden Markov models (HMMs) achieve considerable computational gains by focusing on observations that are regularly spaced in time, and for which the measurement error is negligible. These conditions are often met, in particular for data related to terrestrial animals, so that a likelihood-based HMM approach is feasible. We describe a number of extensions of HMMs for animal movement modelling, including more flexible state transition models and individual random effects (fitted in a non-Bayesian framework). In particular we consider so-called hidden semi-Markov models, which may substantially improve the goodness of fit and provide important insights into the behavioral state switching dynamics. To showcase the expediency of these methods, we consider an application of a hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model to multiple bison movement paths.},

abstract = {Grooming is among the most commonly performed parasite defence behaviour patterns and is effective in removing ticks. Because both tick infestation and grooming activity have a cost, natural selection should favour individuals that match the current level of tick threat with an appropriate level of tick-defence grooming effort. To test this notion, the relationship between seasonal tick challenge and grooming rate by wild, free-ranging impala, Aepyceros melampus, was investigated in Zimbabwe. Adult ticks in the vegetation showed a dramatic decrease from the warm/wet season to the hot/dry season, declining from 2.4 ticks per drag sample and 58 ticks per removal plot to virtually nil. This decline was mirrored by an associated decline in grooming rate by all impala in which self-oral and scratch grooming bouts per h decreased 30-45{\%}. Allogrooming encounters per h (corrected for lying-down time) and total allogrooming delivered, as measured by bouts or episodes delivered per h, decreased for males but did not change for females. Overall percentage of time spent in all forms of grooming declined 37-57{\%}. Multiple regression analysis revealed that, with the seasonal effects of temperature and rainfall held constant, self-grooming rates were significantly and positively correlated with adult tick challenge, indicating that impala adjusted self grooming to seasonal fluctuations in adult tick threat. Allogrooming delivered was influenced by nymphal tick challenge; because the larvae and nymphs of the most abundant tick species favour the ear and neck region (where allogrooming is concentrated), allogrooming appears to function to remove immature ticks from body regions inaccessible to self-oral grooming. These results are what would be expected if grooming serves to remove ticks before they can attach and engorge, and supports the view that grooming is an evolved response to the threat of excessive tick burden in the impala's natural environment.

abstract = {Outer hair cells are the critical element for the sensitivity and sharpness of frequency selectivity of the ear. It is believed that fast motility (electromotility) of these cells is essential for this function. Indeed, force produced by outer hair cells follows their membrane potential very closely at least up to 60kHz. However, it has been pointed out that the cell's receptor potential is attenuated by a low-pass RC circuit inherent to these cells, with the RC roll-off frequencies significantly lower than their operating frequencies. This would render electromotility ineffective in producing force. To address this issue, we assume that multiple degrees of freedom and vibrational modes due to the complex structure of the organ of Corti provide optimal phases for outer hair cells  force to cancel viscous drag. Our derived frequency limit depends on the drag-capacitance product, not directly on the RC time constant. With a reasonable assumption for the viscous drag, the estimated limit is 10 13kHz, exceeding the RC corner frequency. Our analysis shows that a fast-activating potassium current can substantially extend the frequency limit by counteracting the capacitive current.},

abstract = {A number of species of clupeid fish, including blueback herring, American shad, and gulf menhaden, can detect and respond to ultrasonic sounds up to at least 180 kHz, whereas other clupeids, including bay anchovies and Spanish sardines, do not appear to detect sounds above about 4 kHz. Although the location for ultrasound detection has not been proven conclusively, there is a growing body of physiological, developmental, and anatomical evidence suggesting that one end organ of the inner ear, the utricle, is likely to be the detector. The utricle is a region of the inner ear that is very similar in all vertebrates studied to date, except for clupeid fish, where it is highly specialized. Behavioural studies of the responses of American shad to ultrasound demonstrate that they show a graded series of responses depending on the sound level and, to a lesser degree, on the frequency of the stimulus. Low-intensity stimuli elicit a non-directional movement of the fish, whereas somewhat higher sound levels elicit a directional movement away from the sound source. Still higher level sounds produce a "wild" chaotic movement of the fish. These responses do not occur until shad have developed the adult utricle that has a three-part sensory epithelium. We speculate that the response of the American shad (and, presumably, other clupeids that can detect ultrasound) to ultrasound evolved to help these species detect and avoid a major predator - echolocating cetaceans. As dolphins echolocate, the fish are able to hear the sound at over 100 m. If the dolphins detect the fish and come closer, the nature of the behavioural response of the fish changes in order to exploit different avoidance strategies and lower the chance of being eaten by the predators.},

In this context, the first contribution of the paper is a novel non-parametric two-sample homogeneity test for multivariate data based on the well-known Wilcoxon rank statistic. The proposed two-sample homogeneity test statistic can be extended to deal with ordinal or censored data as well as to test for the homogeneity of more than two samples. The second contribution of the paper concerns the use of the proposed test statistic to perform retrospective change-point analysis. It is first shown that the approach is computationally feasible even when looking for a large number of change-points thanks to the use of dynamic programming. Computable asymptotic {\$}p{\$}-values for the test are then provided in the case where a single potential change-point is to be detected. Compared to available alternatives, the proposed approach appears to be very reliable and robust. This is particularly true in situations where the data is contaminated by outliers or corrupted by noise and where the potential changes only affect subsets of the coordinates of the data.},

Here we report acoustic and behavioural changes by fin whales in response to two different types of anthropogenic noise: shipping and airgun noise. Acoustic features of fin whale 20-Hz song notes recorded in the Mediterranean Sea and Northeast Atlantic Ocean were compared for areas with different shipping noise levels, different traffic intensities in the Strait of Gibraltar and during a seismic airgun array survey. In high noise conditions 20-Hz note duration shortened, bandwidth decreased, centre frequency decreased and peak frequency decreased. Similar results were obtained in 20-Hz song notes recorded during a 10-day seismic survey. During the first 72h of the survey, a steady decrease in song received levels and bearings to singers indicated that whales moved away from the airgun array source and out of our detection area, and this displacement persisted for a time period well beyond the 10-day duration of seismic airgun activity. This study provides evidence that male fin whales from two different subpopulations modify song characteristics under increased background noise conditions, and that under seismic airgun activity conditions they leave an area for an extended period. We hypothesize that fin whale acoustic communication is modified to compensate for increased background noise and that a sensitization process may play a role in the observed temporary displacement. The observed acoustic and behavioural changes of this endangered species are discussed in the context of reproduction success and population survival.},

This is the first study to describe the calls of hybrid fur seals. We investigated whether these vocalizations are intermediate to those of their parental species (Antarctic,Arctocephalus gazella , subantarctic, A. tropicalis, and New Zealand, A. forsteri) and discuss the evolutionary implications of hybrids having intermediate vocal traits. Hybrid males' bark calls were intermediate between two distinct groups formed by A. tropicalis and A. gazella/A. forsteri. Patterns of intermediate call characteristics were also discernible for pup attraction calls (given by females) but not for full threat calls (given by males), nor female attraction calls (given by pups); however, for all call types hybrid calls were distinct from those of their parental species. The pattern of hybrid calls being intermediate is consistent with the expectation that call traits are genetically inherited.},

abstract = {Abstract: To facilitate and coordinate the complexities of fission-fusion societies, Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) have developed a multilayered acoustic communication system to effectively transmit signals in the marine environment. Among the many acoustic emissions produced by dolphins, whistles are thought to play a major communicative role. Little is understood about the functions of the diverse whistle repertoire of wild bottlenose dolphins and the influence human activities can have on these sounds. This study provides a detailed investigation into the use and diversity of whistles by a group of eight wild bottlenose dolphins that participate in a provisioning program at Tangalooma, Moreton Island, Australia. Acoustic recordings and concurrent behavioural observations were made during evening feeding sessions. Behaviours were divided into three activities: (1) milling, (2) scanning/foraging (excluding human provisioning), and (3) socialising. Pod separation occasions were also examined. Whistles were classified as either stereotyped or nonstereotyped and divided into five tonal classes based on the shape of the fundamental frequency: (1) sine, (2) up-sweep, (3) down-sweep, (4) flat, and (5) concave. Whistles were then catalogued into distinct whistles types. From 943 min of recordings, 5,682 whistles were analyzed that then were catalogued into 68 distinct whistle types of which 18 were stereotyped and 50 were nonstereotyped. The repetition rate (x = 1.12 whistles per min per dolphin [w/m/d]; SD = 0.61) and diversity of whistles varied between feeding sessions but were not related to the number of dolphins. Distinct whistle types were divided into common or uncommon categories to facilitate correspondence analysis to examine associations between whistles and behaviour activities. Results showed that around 38{\%} of common whistles and 84{\%} of uncommon whistles were closely associated with behaviour activities, particularly socialising and scanning/foraging. Sine whistles were the only tonal class associated with pod separation. This study provides further evidence of the communicative functions of whistles across the repertoire of wild bottlenose dolphins.  },

We argue that this view is an oversimplification, in part because the reactive component of cochlear input impedance, which affects the low-frequency sensitivity of the cochlea, is neglected. Further, we use comparisons of audiograms and transfer functions for stapes (or columella) velocity or pressure in scala vestibuli near the stapes footplate to show that the middle ear by itself is not responsible for limiting high-frequency hearing in the few species for which such comparisons are possible. Finally, we propose that the tonotopic organization of the cochlea plays a crucial role in setting the frequency limits of cochlear sensitivity and hence in determining the bandwidth of hearing.},

abstract = {Toothed whales use intense ultrasonic clicks to echolocate prey and it has been hypothesized that they also acoustically debilitate their prey with these intense sound pulses to facilitate capture. Cephalopods are an important food source for toothed whales, and there has probably been an evolutionary selection pressure on cephalopods to develop a mechanism for detecting and evading sound-emitting toothed whale predators. Ultrasonic detection has evolved in some insects to avoid echolocating bats, and it can be hypothesized that cephalopods might have evolved similar ultrasound detection as an anti-predation measure. We test this hypothesis in the squid Loligo pealeii in a playback experiment using intense echolocation clicks from two squid-eating toothed whale species. Twelve squid were exposed to clicks at two repetition rates (16 and 125 clicks per second) with received sound pressure levels of 199-226 dB re 1 mu Pa (pp) n-mimicking the sound exposure from an echolocating toothed whale as it approaches and captures prey. We demonstrate that intense ultrasonic clicks do not elicit any detectable anti-predator behaviour in L. pealeii and that clicks with received levels up to 226 dB re 1 mu Pa (pp) do not acoustically debilitate this cephalopod species.},

abstract = {Two echolocation experiments are described. They were conducted on the same harbor porpoise housed in a sea pen, one year apart at Neeltje Jans, The Netherlands. The aims were to determine the target detection ability of an echolocating harbor porpoise, with the ultimate goal to predict the distance at which harbor porpoises can detect fishing nets. In experiment 1, the maximum distance at which the 3-year-old porpoise could detect a 7.62-cm diameter water-filled stainless-steel sphere by echolocation was determined psychophysically. The 50{\%}-correct detection threshold was reached when the sphere was at a distance of 26 m from the porpoise's rostrum. In experiment 2, conducted a year later, the maximum detection distance for a 5.08-cm water-filled stainless-steel sphere was 15.9 m. The target strengths of both targets were measured using simulated harbor porpoise echolocation signals and the results, coupled with transmission-loss calculations, indicated that the echo levels received by the porpoise with the targets at the threshold ranges in the two experiments were only 1.3 dB apart. Together with information on the target strengths of various fishing nets, the results of the present study can be used to predict the distance at which the nets can be detected by harbor porpoises.

Direct access to the dynamic electron density as electrons are shared or transferred between atoms in a chemical bond would greatly improve our understanding of molecular bonding and structure. Using reaction microscope techniques, we show that we can capture how the entire valence shell electron density in a molecule rearranges, from molecular-like to atomic-like, as a bond breaks. An intense ultrashort laser pulse is used to ionize a bromine molecule at different times during dissociation, and we measure the total ionization signal and the angular distribution of the ionization yield. Using this technique, we can observe density changes over a surprisingly long time and distance, allowing us to see that the electrons do not localize onto the individual Br atoms until the fragments are far apart ({\^{a}}ˆ¼5.5{\^{A}} {\~{A}}{\ldots}), in a region where the potential energy curves for the dissociation are nearly degenerate. Our observations agree well with calculations of the strong-field ionization rates of the bromine molecule.},

There were no significant differences between thresholds measured using the single and multiple ASSR methods, despite the more rapid nature of data collection using the multiple ASSR method. There was a high degree of variability in ASSR thresholds among subjects; thresholds covered a range of [{\~{}}]40 dB at each tested frequency. As expected, ASSR thresholds were elevated relative to previously reported psychophysical thresholds for California and Steller sea lions. The features of high-frequency hearing limit and relative sensitivity of most ASSR audiograms were, however, similar to those of psychophysical audiograms, suggesting that ASSR methods can be used to improve understanding of hearing demographics in sea lions, especially with respect to high-frequency hearing. Thresholds for one Steller sea lion were substantially elevated relative to all other subjects, demonstrating that ASSR methods can be used to detect hearing loss in sea lions.},

abstract = {Male vocalisations have an important role in mating tactics, breeding strategies and sexual selection. Most studies of vocalisations are concentrated on the time and frequency domains, while the intensity of sound, an important acoustic parameter that should be related to body size, is almost completely ignored as a possible honest signal of resource holding potential (RHP) and cue for mate choice. In this paper, we analyse the repeatability, the correlations with age and size, and the relationship with breeding status of source level (SL) of male vocalisations in the two species of elephant seals (Mirounga leonina and M. angustirostris). We found a high repeatability of SL, equal or higher than the repeatability of frequency domain parameters estimated in a previous study. Southern elephant seal males were significantly larger and produce significantly more powerful vocalisations than northern males. Moreover, in each species SL was related to age, body size, and breeding status of males, but relationships were weak and accounted for just a small proportion of SL variance. We conclude that, although SL may be an honest signal of gross differences of RHP, it is not, by itself, a good candidate for the transmission of high-resolution information on individual phenotype. A combination of SL and frequency components could be, on the contrary, an effective way to communicate RHP.},

Commercial whaling from the 1820s to the early 1900s depleted the population. A combined passive acoustic and visual survey for humpback whales was conducted to assess the current winter distribution of this species in areas where it was exploited to depletion, and to evaluate the effectiveness of using passive acoustic survey methods to detect and locate humpback whales. Visual surveys were conducted independently but simultaneously with acoustic surveys to compare both detection methods. Humpback whale song was detected throughout the entire survey area, indicating that the species continues to occupy its historical range. A total of 31 sightings were made (n = 46 individuals, including three calves). In contrast, at least 78 unique acoustic detections of different singing males was made. The greater number of whales detected acoustically demonstrated the advantage of passive acoustic methods over visual methods for detecting male singing humpback whales; however, some sightings were not detected acoustically, demonstrating that visual methods are superior for detecting non-vocalizing whales. The number of whales detected indicates that the abundance of humpbacks in the eastern and southeastern Caribbean Sea is considerably lower than it was during the 19(th) century whaling period, and much lower than present day abundance in the primary wintering areas in the northeastern Greater Antilles.},

abstract = {Vocal recognition may function as a critical factor in maintaining the phocid mother-pup bond during lactation. For vocal recognition to function, the caller must produce individually distinct calls that are recognised by their intended recipient. Mother-pup vocal recognition has been studied extensively in colonial otariids and appears to be characteristic of this family. Although less numerous, empirical studies of phocid species have revealed a range of recognition abilities. This study investigated whether Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddel-lii) females produce individually distinct 'pup contact' calls that function during natural pair reunions. Fifteen calls from each of nine females recorded in the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica were analysed. One temporal, nine fundamental frequency and five spectral characteristics were measured. Results of the cross-validated Discriminant Function Analysis revealed that mothers produce individually distinct calls with 56{\%} of calls assigned to the correct individual. The probability of achieving this level of discrimination on novel data by chance alone is highly improbable. Analysis of eight mother-pup reunions recorded near McMurdo Sound, Antarctica further demonstrated that these 'pup contact' calls function during natural pair reunions. Behavioural analysis also revealed that pups were chiefly responsible for establishing and maintaining close contact throughout the reunion process. Our study therefore demonstrates that Weddell seal females produce calls with sufficient stereotypy to allow pups to identify them during pair reunions, providing evidence of a functioning mother-pup vocal recognition system.},

abstract = {The ability to identify individuals reliably is often a key prerequisite for animal behaviour studies in the wild. In primates, recognition of other group members can be based on individual differences in the voice, but these cues are typically too subtle for human observers. We applied a combined mechanism consisting of a call feature extraction (mel frequency cepstral coefficients) and pattern recognition algorithm (artificial neural networks) to investigate whether automated caller identification is possible in free-ranging primates. The mechanism was tested for its accuracy in recognizing species, call type and caller identity in a large population of free-ranging blue monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni, in Budongo Forest, Uganda. Classification was highly accurate with 96{\%} at the species, 98{\%} at the call type and 73{\%} at the caller level. It also outperformed conventional discriminant function analysis in the individual recognition task. We conclude that software based on this method will make a powerful tool for future animal behaviour research, as it allows for automatic, fast and objective classifications in different animal species.},

abstract = {The prolonged exposure of birds to environmental stressors known to affect energy status and glucocorticoid secretion may have several physiological consequences including a decrease in immunocompetence, further compromising the survival of individuals. However, the relationships between these parameters remain poorly understood. To this end, changes in body energy content, plasma corticosterone, adaptive (total plasma immunoglobulin Y; IgY) and innate (natural antibodies; NAbs) immune systems were assessed in female mallards (Anas plathyrhynchos) throughout prolonged fasts of different intensities and subsequent re-feeding. Plasma IgY and NAb scores were decreased by 36{\%} and 50{\%}, respectively, during phase II of fasting (protein-sparing phase) and by up to 40{\%} and 80{\%}, respectively, during phase III (protein-wasting phase), indicating a selective regulation of immune function. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of a trade-off between immune function and other energy-demanding activities. However, despite full repletion of fuel reserves and NAbs, only 76{\%} of initial IgY levels were recovered, further supporting a trade-off between innate and adaptive branches of immunity. Although fasting induced significant increases in corticosterone levels to up to 6 times higher than baseline levels during phase III, baseline levels were recovered within 1 day of re-feeding. Our data do not support the hypothesis of a direct regulation of immunocompetence by corticosterone, at least during periods of energy repletion. Finally, the mismatch between the kinetics of body fuels and the two arms of the immune system during fasting and re-feeding suggests that variations in immune system components do not strictly covary with body mass under fluctuating food conditions.},

abstract = {Bottlenose dolphins () develop individually distinctive signature whistles that they use to maintain group cohesion. Unlike the development of identification signals in most other species, signature whistle development is strongly influenced by vocal learning. This learning ability is maintained throughout life, and dolphins frequently copy each other{\^{a}}€™s whistles in the wild. It has been hypothesized that signature whistles can be used as referential signals among conspecifics, because captive bottlenose dolphins can be trained to use novel, learned signals to label objects. For this labeling to occur, signature whistles would have to convey identity information independent of the caller{\^{a}}€™s voice features. However, experimental proof for this hypothesis has been lacking. This study demonstrates that bottlenose dolphins extract identity information from signature whistles even after all voice features have been removed from the signal. Thus, dolphins are the only animals other than humans that have been shown to transmit identity information independent of the caller{\^{a}}€™s voice or location.},

abstract = {During the 4-month period of offspring dependence, northern fur seal, Callorhinus ursinus, mothers and pups use a well-developed multimodal recognition ability to routinely find one another within large and dense breeding aggregations. I studied the vocal/auditory aspect of this ability to look at operational differences between the two members of a recognition dyad. If parent-offspring conflict theory is applied to animal communication behaviour, we should expect unequal selective forces acting on parents and offspring. In northern fur seal maternal recognition dyads, I expected pups to expend more energy in the reunion process because they carry the greater burden of a failed reunion. Furthermore, in terms of signal detection theory, pups should have a lower rejection threshold (lower bias) than mothers. To address these questions, I conducted vocal playback experiments and behavioural observations on a natural population of northern fur seals in the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, U.S.A. Although playback results support mutual vocal recognition, pups were both more vocally responsive and made more recognition errors (i.e. false alarms). Behavioural observations, including search time, distance travelled, signalling behaviour and contact with nonoffspring show that pups expend more effort in the reunion process. These findings are consistent with expectations and begin to quantify how selection pressure on recognition behaviour can vary at different stages of development.},

abstract = {A paradoxical phenomenon was found in the auditory system of dolphins: weak sounds suppressed the brain responses to much stronger sounds. This occurred when the brain evoked potentials to rhythmic sound amplitude modulations were recorded. The response was markedly suppressed by addition of another sound of higher frequency and down to 40 dB lower intensity than the amplitude-modulated signal. Only the sustained rhythmic response was suppressed while transient on-response was not, thus indicating that the suppression influenced the ability of evoked potentials to follow rapid amplitude modulations. This prevents weak sounds from being masked by stronger ones. It may help a dolphin to perceive weaker echo-signals in the background of stronger emitted pulses.},

abstract = {Movement is important to all organisms, and accordingly it is addressed in a huge number of papers in the literature. Of nearly 26,000 papers referring to movement, an estimated 34{\%} focused on movement by measuring it or testing hypotheses about it. This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and highlights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these components. Most studies simply measured and described the movement of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promulgates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, potentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and subdisciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully understand the ecology of movement.},

abstract = {Herein, we report evidence of an envenomation apparatus (EA) in two different species of extinct "giant" shrews, Beremendia and an indeterminate soricine (Mammalia, Eulipotyphla, Soricidae), documented by very well preserved fossil specimens recovered from two Early Pleistocene cave deposits of the Sierra de Atapuerca in Burgos, Spain. The two soricine taxa from Atapuerca have evolved specialized teeth as EAs, which differ from those of recently reported mammals of the Paleocene age, being more similar to the ones described in the modern Solenodon. This discovery reveals the first instance of shrews possessing what appears to be an EA, an evolutionary adaptation that, in these species, was probably related to an increase in body mass and hunting of a larger-sized prey. The Atapuerca specimens would have a highly specialized EA, one of the very few reported for an extinct or living mammal of any time. In addition to the presence of a gutter-like groove along the medial side of the crown of the lower incisors, these two species also present stout jaws and a modified mandibular symphysis with a conspicuous cavity, which in life would likely contain large amounts of connective tissue. The strong mandible architecture of these large shrews would be, in this way, reinforced by a more immovable symphysis, increasing the bite force exerted over a potential prey. This adaptation, together with the grooved incisors, would ensure a rapid and efficient transmission of the poisonous saliva to paralyze relatively large-sized prey.},

abstract = {Motivation: There is a great need to develop analytical methodology to analyze and to exploit the information contained in gene expression data. Because of the large number of genes and the complexity of biological networks, clustering is a useful exploratory technique for analysis of gene expression data. Other classical techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), have also been applied to analyze gene expression data. Using different data analysis techniques and different clustering algorithms to analyze the same data set can lead to very different conclusions. Our goal is to study the effectiveness of principal components (PCs) in capturing cluster structure. Specifically, using both real and synthetic gene expression data sets, we compared the quality of clusters obtained from the original data to the quality of clusters obtained after projecting onto subsets of the principal component axes. Results: Our empirical study showed that clustering with the PCs instead of the original variables does not necessarily improve, and often degrades, cluster quality. In particular, the first few PCs (which contain most of the variation in the data) do not necessarily capture most of the cluster structure. We also showed that clustering with PCs has different impact on different algorithms and different similarity metrics. Overall, we would not recommend PCA before clustering except in special circumstances. Contact: kayee@cs.washington.edu Supplementary information: http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kayee/pca},

abstract = {In 2002 and 2003, tagged sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) were experimentally exposed to airgun pulses in the Gulf of Mexico, with the tags providing acoustic recordings at measured ranges and depths. Ray trace and parabolic equation (PE) models provided information about sound propagation paths and accurately predicted time of arrival differences between multipath arrivals. With adequate environmental information, a broadband acoustic PE model predicted the relative levels of multipath arrivals recorded on the tagged whales. However, lack of array source signature data limited modeling of absolute received levels. Airguns produce energy primarily below 250 Hz, with spectrum levels about 20-40 dB lower at 1 kHz. Some arrivals recorded near the surface in 2002 had energy predominantly above 500 Hz; a surface duct in the 2002 sound speed profile helps explain this effect, and the beampattern of the source array also indicates an increased proportion of high-frequency sound at near-horizontal launch angles. These findings indicate that airguns sometimes expose animals to measurable sound energy above 250 Hz, and demonstrate the influences of source and environmental parameters on characteristics of received airgun pulses. The study also illustrates that on-axis source levels and simple geometric spreading inadequately describe airgun pulse propagation and the extent of exposure zones.

abstract = {Auditory evoked potential (AEP) responses were recorded during echolocation in an Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) trained to accept suction-cup EEG electrodes and detect targets by echolocation. AEP recording was triggered by the echolocation clicks of the animal. Three targets with target strengths of -34, -28 and -22 dB were used at a target distance of 2 to 6.5 m for each target. The results demonstrated that the AEP appeared to both outgoing echolocation clicks and echoes during echolocation, with AEP complexes consisting of alternative positive and negative waves. The echo-related AEP amplitudes were obviously lower than the outgoing click-related AEP amplitudes for all the targets at the investigated target distances. However, for targets with target strengths of -22 and -28 dB, the peak-to-peak amplitudes of the echo-related AEPs were dependent on the target distances. The echo-related AEP response amplitudes increased at further target distances, demonstrating an overcompensation of echo attenuation with target distance in the echo-perception system of the dolphin biosonar. Measurement and analysis of outgoing click intensities showed that the click levels increased with target distance (R) by a factor of approximately 10 to 17.5 logR depending on target strength. The results demonstrated that a dual-component biosonar control system formed by intensity compensation behavior in both the transmission and receiving phases of a biosonar cycle exists synchronously in the dolphin biosonar system.},

abstract = {Abstract  Geographic variation of vocal behaviour may be reflective of genetic, cultural and ecological differences between locations. Such differences have been previously reported in six pinnipeds, including Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii). This study investigated whether the acoustic characteristics of airborne Weddell seal mother and pup ‘contact' calls vary geographically between the Vestfold Hills and McMurdo Sound. From each location, 72 mother and 120 pup calls were analysed, with 11 acoustic characteristics measured. MANOVA and Discriminant function analysis (DFA) identified significant differences in several fundamental frequency characteristics. The cross-validated DFA classified greater than 60{\%} of mother and pup vocalisations to the correct location. For novel calls, the probabilities of correctly classifying these percentages by chance are low. Additionally, ordinal logistic regression identified significant differences in the maximum energy distribution of mother and pup vocalisations. For pups, this variation is likely the result of genetic differences between the two populations. Nevertheless, results support suggestions that, when compared with underwater repertoire differences, airborne within-call differences are less efficient at identifying Weddell seal breeding populations.},

abstract = {During a sperm whale stranding at Romo, the Wadden Sea, Denmark, on 4 December 1997, we were notified in time to start acoustic transmission measurements in the spermaceti complex 1 h after the specimen was seen alive. Frequency-modulated sound pulses, sweeping from 30 kHz to 10 kHz in 25 ms, were injected at the frontal surface at two positions: at the distal sac, and at the center of the junk (a compartmentalized structure below the spermaceti organ). A hydrophone next to the projector served as receiver. The analyses of the recordings show a repetitive, decaying reflection pattern at both projection sites, reminiscent of the multi-pulse click peculiar to sperm whales, although with minor differences in the duration of the intra-click intervals. This experimental evidence supports the Norris and Harvey (1972) theory of click generation in the spermaceti organ. Accordingly, the click is composed of a primary event, followed by a train of reflected pulses, spaced by the time required for the event to travel back and forth between air sacs (reflectors) at each end of the organ. The results also show that the junk readily transmits sound and probably is in acoustic contact with the spermaceti organ.},

Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) and broadband click stimuli were used to determine the modulation rate transfer function (MRTF) of a neonate Risso's dolphin, Grampus griseus, thus estimating the dolphin's temporal resolution, and quantifying its physiological delay to sound stimuli. The Risso's dolphin followed sound stimuli up to 1,000 Hz with a second peak response at 500 Hz. A weighted MRTF reflected that the animal followed a broad range of rates from 100 to 1,000 Hz, but beyond 1,250 Hz the animal's hearing response was simply an onset/offset response. Similar to other mammals, the dolphin's AEP response to a single stimulus was a series of waves. The delay of the first wave, PI, was 2.76 ms and the duration of the multi-peaked response was 4.13 ms. The MRTF was similar in shape to other marine mammals except that the response delay was among the fastest measured. Results predicted that the Risso's dolphin should have the ability to follow clicks and echoes while foraging at close range.},

@article{Dunning1992,
abstract = {We studied the response of the alewife Alosa pseudoharengus to high-frequency sound to develop an acoustic system for preventing fish from entering power plant intakes. Four groups of alewives were subjected to different frequencies of sounds ranging from 110 to 150 kHz at sound pressure levels (SPLs, given in decibels [dB] in reference to 1 {\&}{\#}956;Pa) ranging from 125 to 180 dB. Each group of 20 or 25 fish was tested in a cage that was suspended in a flooded rock quarry. During the day, alewives schooled and strongly avoided pulsed tones (500 ms pulses, 1,000 ms apart) of 110 and 125 kHz at or above 175 dB, a continuous tone of 125 kHz at 172 dB, and pulsed broadband sound between 117 and 133 kHz at or above 157 dB. Although alewives habituated to tones, they avoided pulsed broadband sound at 163 dB more consistently. In one test, alewives did not habituate to this sound after 150 min of repeated exposure, The more consistent response to the broadband sound was probably due to the range of frequencies in this signal. At night, alewives did not school, did not swim actively, and did not react as strongly to the broadband sound. We believe that the diminished avoidance response at night was due to the absence of schooling and to reduced swimming activity.},

@article{Ghose2009,
abstract = {Insectivorous echolocating bats face a formidable array of defenses employed by their airborne prey. One such insect defense is the ultrasound-triggered dive, which is a sudden, rapid drop in altitude, sometimes all the way to the ground. Although many previous studies have investigated the dynamics of such dives and their effect on insect survival rate, there has been little work on how bats may adapt to such an insect defense employed in the middle of pursuit. In this study we investigated how big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) adjust their pursuit strategy when flying praying mantises (Parasphendale agrionina) execute evasive, ultrasound-triggered dives. Although the mantis dive occasionally forced the bat to completely abort its chase (25{\%} trials), in a number of cases (75{\%} trials) the bat followed the mantis into the dive. In such cases the bat kept its sonar beam locked onto the target and maneuvered to maintain the same time efficient strategy it adopted during level flight pursuit, though it was ultimately defeated by the dive. This study suggests that although the mantis dive can be effective in evading the bat, it does not always deter the bat from continuing pursuit and, given enough altitude, the bat can potentially capture diving prey using the same flight strategy it employs to intercept prey in level flight.},

abstract = {We assessed scientists' ability to detect declines of marine mammal stocks based on recent levels of survey effort, when the actual decline is precipitous. We defined a precipitous decline as a 50{\%} decrease in abundance in 15 yr, at which point a stock could be legally classified as "depleted" under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act. We assessed stocks for three categories of cetaceans: large whales (n= 23, most of which are listed as endangered), beaked whales (n= 11, potentially vulnerable to anthropogenic noise), and small whales/dolphins/porpoises (n= 69, bycatch in fisheries and important abundant predators), for two categories of pinnipeds with substantially different survey precision: counted on land (n= 13) and surveyed on ice (n= 5), and for a category containing polar bear and sea otter stocks (n= 6). The percentage of precipitous declines that would not be detected as declines was 72{\%} for large whales, 90{\%} for beaked whales, and 78{\%} for dolphins/porpoises, 5{\%} for pinnipeds on land, 100{\%} for pinnipeds on ice, and 55{\%} for polar bears/sea otters (based on a one-tailed t-test, 03B1= 0.05), given the frequency and precision of recent monitoring effort. We recommend alternatives to improve performance.},

abstract = {Males and females of the Neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros, communicate with vibratory songs transmitted through plants. In this study, we examined the responses of the egg parasitoid Telenomus podisi to vibratory signals of these bugs. Telenomus podisi females responded with orientated movements to the vibratory signals of female songs on plants and on an artificial substrate, whereas male songs, duets or continuous pure tone vibratory signals failed to elicit any response. In addition, T podisi females had a higher turning rate when stimulated with female songs, indicating some effect on their kinetic behaviour. This is the first demonstration of a parasitoid eavesdropping on the sexual vibratory signals of insects. The potential mechanism of this directionality and its adaptive significance are discussed.

abstract = {Walruses (Odobenus rosmarus) are highly vocal amphibious mammals with a range of anatomical specializations that can provide plasticity to their sound emissions. The objective of this descriptive study was to determine whether contingency learning could be used to increase variability and induce novelty in the acoustic behavior of walruses. The subjects were two twelve-year-old captive walruses, a male and a female that had previously been conditioned using food reinforcement to produce several specific sounds in response to different discriminative cues. In the current task, these individuals were encouraged to produce novel sounds and novel sound combinations in air by withholding reinforcement for sounds previously emitted in a given session and providing reinforcement only for qualitative differences in emitted sounds. Following training in air, the walruses were tested under water with the same reinforcement contingency. The subjects responded as they had done in air, by varying their underwater sound emissions until reinforcement was provided. Many of the sounds and sound combinations produced by the subjects during underwater testing were quite different from those produced during training in air and those produced under water during baseline observations. Both the male and female spontaneously emitted knocks and soft bells which are components of the songs known to be emitted by mature male walruses during the breeding season. The finding that reinforced variability can induce creativity in sound production is consistent with recent experiments on budgerigar birds showing that vocal topographies, like motor responses, may be influenced by contingency learning.},
