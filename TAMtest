This is really just a test file as I don't seem to be a "contributor" to this repository... testing I can add a file say...

Apparently I can add a file, now just testing I can edit further... Editing directly on git just as a test

That worked, I guess now I need to understand how this can be used effectively. From what I understood from Stacy, she has local copies of files which she then "pushes"
to the git repository
