\title{Compute mean of sample blocks}
\usage{
block_mean(X, n, nov)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A vector or a matrix containing samples of a signal in each column.}

\item{n}{The number of samples from X to use in each analysis block.}

\item{nov}{(optional) The number of samples that the next block overlaps the previous block. The default value is 0.}
}
\value{
A vector or matrix containing the mean value of each block. If X is a mxn matrix, Y is pxn where p is the number of complete n-length blocks with nov that can be made out of m samples, i.e., n+(p-1)*(n-nov) < m
}
\description{
This function is used to compute the means of successive blocks of samples.
